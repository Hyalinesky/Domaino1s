## Quick Start

### Download Model Parameters

Due to the anonymity policy of ACL 2025, we cannot provide a non-anonymous repository to store model weight files as they require substantial storage space. The weights and training data will be fully open-sourced after the paper is accepted.

The inference code for our model is located in `inference/infer.py`, training datasets CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k are in `train/processed`, and the complete test sets are in `test/ directory`.

### Inference

```
python inference/infer.py
```
