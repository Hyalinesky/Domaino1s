Here is question: Under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, a prisoner cannot bring suit to challenge prison conditions under federal law ""until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted."" 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a). This exhaustion requirement is not subject to ""futility or other exceptions,"" Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 746 n.6 (2001), and may not be waived by a district court, Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002). This case presents the following question:
Does a prisoner satisfy the Prison Litigation Reform Act's administrative-exhaustion requirement by filing an untimely or otherwise procedurally defective administrative appeal?
Options:
A. holding that it would be inconsistent with Congress' intent to require exhaustion of ""optional appeals"" through state procedures after ""an aggrieved party has exhausted all administrative remedies expressly prescribed"" by Congress in the Administrative Procedures Act (""APA"")
B. holding that, where prison overcrowding was due to state budget shortfalls, a court-mandated prison-population limit was ""necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights"" under the Prison Litigation Reform Act
C. holding that the district court properly dismissed action for lack of jurisdiction where the plaintiff had not exhausted administrative remedies under § 2675 prior to filing suit; stating, ""The FTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies.""
D. holding that exhaustion of administrative remedies is still required to bring a federal suit, even when administrative remedies are no longer available due to the inmate's failure to meet the administrative deadlines: ""Proper exhaustion demands compliance with an agency's deadlines and other critical procedural rules . . . .""
E. holding that ""failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act], and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints""

Here is question: Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, forbids a publicly traded company, a mutual fund, or ""any ... contractor [or] subcontractor ... of such company [to] ... discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of"" certain protected activity. (Emphasis added). The First Circuit held that under section 1514A such contractors and subcontractors, if privately-held, may retaliate against their own employees, and are prohibited only from retaliating against employees of the public companies with which they work. The question presented is:
Is an employee of a privately-held contractor or subcontractor of a public company protected from retaliation by section 1514A?
Options:
A. holding that whether an expression by a public employee is constitutionally protected is a question of ultimate fact for the court and not subject to limited review under the ""clearly erroneous"" standard
B. holding generally that if employee conduct is protected under federal law, then state law which interferes with the exercise of such federally protected rights is preempted
C. holding that management company's “managerial responsibilities” that gave it “substantial control of the terms and conditions of the work” of the employees justified considering management company an employer
D. holding that whistleblower protection under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1514A, extended to employees of private contractors and subcontractors serving public companies

Here is question: Bankruptcy Rules permit discharge of a student loan only through an adversary proceeding, commenced by filing a complaint and serving it and a summons on an appropriate agent of the creditor. Instead, debtor merely included a declaration of discharge in his Chapter 13 plan and mailed it to creditor's post office box. Does such procedure meet the rigorous demands of due process and entitle the resulting orders to respect under principles of res judicata?
Student loans are statutorily non-dischargeable in bankruptcy unless repayment would cause the debtor an ""undue hardship."" Debtor failed to prove undue hardship in an adversary proceeding as required by the Bankruptcy Rules, and instead, merely declared a discharge in his Chapter 13 plan. Are the orders confirming the plan and discharging debtor void?
Options:
A. holding that the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act,which ordered a debtor railroad company's bankruptcy estate to pay benefits to former employees of the debtor, was a law on the subject of bankruptcies and violated the Bankruptcy Clause
B. holding that, in a case involving a mortgage on real property, a bankruptcy discharge ""extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim  namely, an action against the debtor in personam  while leaving intact another  namely, an action against the debtor in rem. ""
C. holding that property seized by a creditor prior to debtor's bankruptcy was property of the estate even though creditor--the IRS--held a secured interest--a tax lien--in the property
D. holding that ""it is sensible to view the debtor-in-possession as the same `entity' which existed before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, but empowered by virtue of the Bankruptcy Code to deal with its contracts and property in a manner it could not have employed absent the bankruptcy filing""

Here is question: ERISA preempts any state law that ""relates to"" ERISA-covered employee benefit plans, unless the law is within the statute's insurance ""saving"" clause, which saves from preemption any state law ""which regulates insurance."" Petitioners include health maintenance organizations (""HMOs"") that make limited-size networks of health care providers available to ERISA health benefit plans. Kentucky's ""Any Willing Provider"" (""AWP"") statutes, however, require HMOs to open their networks to any provider in the geographical area willing to meet the network contract terms. The Sixth Circuit below unanimously held that Kentucky's AWP statutes relate to ERISA-covered benefit plans, but by a 2-1 decision joined the Fourth Circuit in holding that AWP statutes are not preempted by ERISA because they are laws ""which regulate[] insurance,"" rejecting contrary decisions of the Eighth and Fifth Circuits.
Are state ""Any Willing Provider"" statutes preempted by ERISA, or are they saved from preemption because they are laws ""which regulate insurance""?
Options:
A. holding that ERISA preempted New York Human Rights Law to the extent that it imposed conflicting insurance obligations than required under ERISA but that New York Disability Law was not preempted if not applied to ERISA plans
B. holding that Illinois statute requiring HMOs to provide independent medical review of certain claim denials is saved from preemption because the statute regulates insurance within the meaning of ERISA's savings clause
C. holding former exemption to the Georgia garnishment statute, O.C.G.A. § 18-4-22.1, preempted by ERISA because the statute expressly referenced ERISA plans and singled out welfare benefit plans for different treatment in state garnishment proceedings
D. holding that for a state law to be deemed a law which regulates insurance, and therefore saved from ERISA preemption, the state law must ""be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance"" and ""substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured""
E. holding that a local law, requiring employers to continue to offer health insurance to employees receiving workers' compensation benefits, had a “reference to” ERISA plans because employer-offered health insurance is necessarily part of an ERISA plan and the law, therefore, was premised on the existence of an ERISA plan

Here is question: This case involves a challenge to the FCC's jurisdiction to implement §332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934, titled ""Preservation of Local Zoning Authority."" Section 332(c) (7) imposes certain limitations on State and local zoning authority over the placement of wireless service facilities, but authorizes the FCC to address only one of these limitations; it states that no other provision ""in this Act"" may ''limit'' or ""affect"" State and local authority over wireless facilities placement. The FCC concluded that other provisions ""in this Act"" authorize it to adopt national zoning standards to implement §332(c)(7). The Fifth Circuit deferred to the FCC's jurisdictional determination applying Chevron U. S.A. Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), but acknowledged that ""[the Supreme Court has not yet conclusively resolved the question of whether Chevron applies in the context of an agency's determination of its own statutory jurisdiction, and the circuit courts of appeals have adopted different approaches to this issue."" The case presents two questions:
Whether, contrary to the decisions of at least two other circuits, and in light of this Court's guidance, a court should apply Chevron to review an agency's determination of its own jurisdiction.
Options:
A. holding that “there is no difference, insofar as the validity of agency action is concerned, between an agency's exceeding the scope of its authority (its ‘jurisdiction’) and its exceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has”
B. holding that courts in the District of Columbia are local rather than federal because Congress ""expressly created"" the courts pursuant to its plenary authority and created a body with authority over matters of ""strictly local concern""
C. holding that ""filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance - it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.""
D. holding that ""administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for Chevron deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority""

Here is question: Is an oral complaint of a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act protected conduct under the anti-retaliation provision, 29 U.S.C. § 215(a)(3)?
Options:
A. holding that application of Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA"") to transportation employees employed by local government does not contravene the Commerce Clause because labor conditions of those employees affect interstate commerce
B. holding that the ""plain language"" of the Fair Labor Standards Act's ""willful"" liquidated damages standard requires that ""the employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the statute,"" without regard to the outrageousness of the conduct at issue
C. holding that an opinion letter by the administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act was not entitled to deference as a matter of law, but only ""respect"" to the extent that it has the ""power to persuade""
D. holding that ""hearing"" under the Administrative Procedure Act requires that parties have fair notice of what agency intends to do and that parties have opportunity to comment; but ""hearing"" does not require oral testimony, cross-examination, or oral argument

Here is question: Whether a passenger in a vehicle subject to a traffic stop is thereby “detained” for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, thus allowing the passenger to contest the legality of the traffic stop.
Options:
A. holding that an arrest supported by probable cause and following a traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of police officer's subjective motivation to search vehicle for evidence of crime
B. holding that Fourth Amendment was not violated where, during an “undoubtedly justified traffic stop” an officer observed the vehicle's vehicle identification number (VIN), which “is by law present in one of two locations—either inside the doorjamb, or atop the dashboard and thus ordinarily in plain view of someone outside the automobile”
C. holding that subjective motive of officers for traffic stop is irrelevant where stop is supported by probable cause and thus rejecting “any argument that the constitutional reasonableness of traffic stops depends on the actual motivations of the individual officers involved”
D. holding that ordering a driver out of his or her car during a routine traffic stop is not inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment, and noting that Pennsylvania did not go so far as to argue that frisking a driver during a routine traffic stop would always be consistent with the Fourth Amendment
E. holding that automobile passengers are seized during traffic stops even though the police command to stop is directed to the driver because a reasonable person in the passenger seat would not feel free to leave once the police have stopped the vehicle

Here is question: Whether the term “felony drug offense” as used in federal statute requiring imposition of enhanced mandatory minimum 20 years’ imprisonment when drug offender has “prior conviction for a felony drug offense” must be read in pari materia with federal statutes defining both “felony” and “felony drug offense”, so as to require imposition of minimum 20—year sentence only if prior drug conviction is both punishable by more than one year in prison and characterized as a felony by controlling law.
Options:
A. holding that a South Carolina conviction for possession of cocaine is a conviction for a ""felony drug offense"", as that term is used in § 841(b), because it is ""punishable by more than one year,"" regardless of the fact that the state of conviction classified the offense as a misdemeanor
B. holding that only a controlled substance violation that is punishable as a felony under the federal Controlled Substances Act can constitute an aggravated felony and finding that it is not enough that the crime is punishable as a felony under state law
C. holding that a defendant convicted of a possession offense that has not been enhanced based on a prior conviction has not been convicted of an aggravated felony
D. holding that to qualify as a conviction relating to a federally controlled substance, ""a state drug offense must meet two conditions: It must 'necessarily' proscribe conduct that is an offense under the [Controlled Substances Act], and the [Act] must 'necessarily' prescribe felony punishment for that conduct""
E. holding that a buyer who uses a telephone to make a misdemeanor drug purchase does not “facilitate” felony drug distribution because the term “facilitate” is limited to someone other than a principal or necessary actor

Here is question: This case presents the issue that recently divided this Court, 4-4, in Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Omega, S.A., 131 S. Ct. 565 (2010). Under § 602(a)(1) of the Copyright Act, it is impermissible to import a work ""without the authority of the owner"" of the copyright. But the first-sale doctrine, codified at § 109(a), allows the owner of a copy ""lawfully made under this title"" to sell or otherwise dispose of the copy without the copyright owner's permission.
The question presented is how these provisions apply to a copy that was made and legally acquired abroad and then imported into the United States. Can such a foreign-made product never be resold within the United States without the copyright owner's permission, as the Second Circuit held in this case? Can such a foreign-made product sometimes be resold within the United States without permission, but only after the owner approves an earlier sale in this country, as the Ninth Circuit held in Costco? Or can such a product always be resold without permission within the United States, so long as the copyright owner authorized the first sale abroad, as the Third Circuit has indicated?

A. holding the first sale doctrine applies to copies of a copyrighted work manufactured abroad

C. holding constitutional a statute providing that a mineral interest would lapse to the surface owner if the interest owner either made no use of the interest, or failed to file a claim with the State, within a twenty year period
D. holding that analysis of effect of a zoning commission's application of zoning ordinances on the value of an owner's property and investment-backed expectations ""cannot be measured until a final decision is made as to how the regulations will be applied to [the owner's] property""
E. holding that ""[a]t least in the absence of an interference with an owner's legal right to dispose of his land, even a substantial reduction of the attractiveness of the property to potential purchasers does not entitle the owner to compensation under the Fifth Amendment""

Options:
A. holding state tort action was not preempted by FMVSS 208 after examining the regulation, its history, the agency's contemporaneous explanation of its objectives, and the agency's current views of the regulation's preemptive effect
B. holding that federal law preempted state failure-to-warn claims against generic drug manufacturers because ""[i]t was not lawful under federal law for the Manufacturers to do what state law required of them,"" i.e., ""to use a different, stronger label"" than the one approved by the FDA
C. holding that once the FHWA approved the warning devices to be installed at a railroad crossing and the devices were installed using federal funds, ""the federal standard for adequacy displaced [state] statutory and common law addressing the same subject, thereby preempting"" a failure to maintain adequate warning devices claim under state law

Options:
A. holding under ICCTA's predecessor statute that ""transportation by rail carrier"" includes ""service provided by interstate rail carriers on `equipment which they own'""
B. holding that § 14501(c) preempts two provisions of a Maine law regulating the delivery of tobacco within the state; Maine's attempt to require tobacco retailers to employ only delivery companies that follow particular delivery service procedures created a direct “connection with” motor carrier services— i.e., the transportation and delivery of goods
C. holding that the carrier was the owner's agent for the ""single, limited purpose"" of determining limitations on the liability of the carrier's downstream subcontractor and that it would be ""unsustainable"" to find that the carrier was ""automatically empowered to be the cargo owner's agent in every sense""
D. holding that NEPA does not require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to evaluate the environmental effects of cross-border motor carrier operations because the agency lacked the discretion to prevent those operations

Here is question: ERISA's  ""anti-cutback""  rule,  29  U.S.C.  §  1054(g),  generally  prohibits  any pension  plan  amendment  which  has  the  effect  of  eliminating  or  reducing  a participant's  early  retirement  benefit  or  a  retirement-type  subsidy  with respect  to  benefits  attributable  to  service  before  the  amendment.    The Seventh  Circuit,  expressly  acknowledging  its  direct  conflict  with  a  1998 decision  of  the  Fifth  Circuit,  held  that  a  pension  plan  amendment  which expands  the  types  of  post-retirement  employment  that  trigger  mandatory suspension  of  early  retirement  benefits  violates  the  anti-  cutback  rule  when applied  to  suspend  the  benefits  of  participants  who  retired  before  the amendment.

B. holding that a plan administrator's denial of ERISA benefits is reviewed under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard only if the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan
C. holding that congressional reduction of social welfare benefits, or even elimination of such benefits, does not constitute a “taking” of private property
D. holding that a state law claim, brought by an employee who was terminated because of the employer's desire to avoid paying pension benefits, was preempted because an element of the state cause of action was whether an ERISA-regulated pension plan existed and the state law claim therefore had a “reference” to ERISA

Here is question: This Court has held that the test to determine if a person is ""in custody"" to require warnings pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), is an objective test (i.e., whether there is a ""formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement"" of the degree associated with a formal arrest).  Thompson v. Keohane,  516 U.S. 99, 112 (1995) (quoting California v.  Beheler, 463  U.S. 1121, 1125  (1983)); Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420,442 (1984). The question presented is:

B. holding that Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964), applied retroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions were released
C. holding that court was nowhere close to the mark in ruling that the state court had unreasonably applied established federal law by failing to consider a suspect's age when determining custodial status, where “[the Supreme Court's] opinions applying the Miranda custody test have not mentioned the suspect's age, much less mandated its consideration”
D. holding that a law enforcement officer's unarticulated subjective belief as to whether the person being questioned is a criminal suspect is irrelevant to the custody determination because a custody assessment depends on the objective circumstances of an interrogation

Options:
A. holding that a company may bring a claim against a competitor under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125, for misleading product labeling, even where the challenged labeling may be permitted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 301 –399f

Before the decision below, the Federal Circuit in two en banc decisions held that Section 7266(a) constitutes a statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling under this Court's decision in Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89 (1990).
Whether the time limit in Section 7266(a) constitutes a statute of limitations subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, or whether the time limit is jurisdictional and therefore bars application of that doctrine.
Options:
A. holding that the time limit for filing a petition for certiorari is not jurisdictional
B. holding that statutory time limit for filing attorney-fee reimbursement applications under Equal Access to Justice Act was not jurisdictional because time limit did not “describe what ‘classes of cases,’ the [court] is competent to adjudicate; instead, the section relate[d] only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within court's adjudicatory authority”

Options:
A. holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages
B. holding that a local law, requiring employers to continue to offer health insurance to employees receiving workers' compensation benefits, had a “reference to” ERISA plans because employer-offered health insurance is necessarily part of an ERISA plan and the law, therefore, was premised on the existence of an ERISA plan
C. holding that ERISA preempts a beneficiary's state-law causes of action based on improper processing of claims for benefits because the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA are meant to be the exclusive vehicle for such actions
D. holding that a state law claim, brought by an employee who was terminated because of the employer's desire to avoid paying pension benefits, was preempted because an element of the state cause of action was whether an ERISA-regulated pension plan existed and the state law claim therefore had a “reference” to ERISA

Whether withdrawing from a conspiracy prior to the statute of limitations period negates an element of a conspiracy charge such that, once a defendant meets his burden of production that he did so withdraw, the burden of persuasion rests with the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member of the conspiracy during the relevant period -- a fundamental due process question that is the subject of a well-developed circuit split.
Options:
A. holding that race based peremptory strikes for jurors violate the equal protection rights of the challenged jurors and that the court, by allowing this to occur, had ""involved itself with invidious discrimination.""
B. holding that the state appellate court's conclusion that no Batson violation occurred was reasonable where the “trial court credited the prosecutor's race-neutral explanations”
C. holding that defendant remains guilty of conspiracy for acts occurring until withdrawal from the conspiracy
D. holding that the trial court’s erroneous ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove the existence of an alleged element of the crime at defendant's trial that it was not, in fact, required to prove was not subject to appellate review
E. holding that because ""conduct as consistent with permissible competition as with illegal conspiracy does not, standing alone, support an inference of antitrust conspiracy,"" a plaintiff must ""must show that the inference of conspiracy is reasonable in light of the competing inferences of independent action""

Cooper rejected the offer, and he was convicted as charged. Cooper does not assert that any error occurred at the trial. On habeas review, the Sixth Circuit found that because there is a reasonable probability that Cooper would have accepted the plea offer had he been adequately advised, his Sixth Amendment rights were violated.

Here is question: In California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 585-586 (2000), this Court specified how States could structure a top-two primary system that does not violate the associational rights of a political party. Pursuant to the Initiative power which the People of the State of Washington reserved to themselves in their State Constitution, the voters of the State of Washington enacted a top-two primary law that the Washington State Grange had drafted to comply with Jones. That law makes the State primary a contest to select the two most popular candidates for the November ballot - regardless of party nominations or party selection. That law also allows candidates for certain offices to disclose on the ballot the name of the party (if any) which that candidate personally prefers. The Ninth Circuit invalidated this top-two primary system in its entirety, holding that the First Amendment (applied to the States through the 14th Amendment) prohibits a State from so allowing a candidate to disclose the name of the party he or she personally prefers on the ballot.
Does the First Amendment prohibit top-two election systems that allow a candidate to disclose on the ballot the name of the party he or she personally prefers?

A. holding that the State's legitimate interest in preventing political party raiding was not sufficient to justify the substantial restraint of a statute prohibiting voters from voting in a party primary if they had voted in another party's primary within the preceding twenty-three months

Here is question: This Court has held that antitrust “per se rules are appropriate only for conduct that . . .  would always or almost always tend to restrict competition.” Modern economic analysis establishes that vertical minimum resale price maintenance does not meet this condition because the practice often has substantial competition-enhancing effects. QUESTIONS PRESENTED:
The question presented is whether vertical minimum resale price maintenance agreements should be deemed per se illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or whether they should instead be evaluated under the rule of reason.
Options:
A. holding that the goal of judicial scrutiny is to “distinguish between restraints with anticompetitive effect that are harmful to the consumer and restraints stimulating competition that are in the consumer's best interest”

Here is question: After this Court decided Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that its promulgation of motor vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards under Title II of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. § 7521(a)(1), compelled regulation of carbon dioxide and other GHGs under the CAA's Title I prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) and Title V stationary-source permitting programs. Even though EPA determined that including GHGs in these programs would vastly expand the programs contrary to Congress's intent, EPA adopted rules adding GHGs to the pollutants covered. The panel below held the CAA and Massachusetts compelled inclusion of GHGs and, based on that holding, dismissed all petitions to review the GHG permitting program rules on standing grounds.

A. holding that the contract doctrine of licensee estoppel was trumped by the federal policy embodied in the patent laws
B. holding that congressional attempt to abrogate states' sovereign immunity from patent infringement claims under Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act was invalid exercise of Article I commerce or patent powers and not justified under Fourteenth Amendment § 5 enforcement powers
C. holding that, where a patent licensee threatened with a lawsuit for patent infringement files a declaratory judgment action, the burden of proving infringement remains on the patentee, rather than shifting to the licensee to prove non-infringement
D. holding that where a plaintiff “eliminated the imminent threat of harm by simply not doing what he claimed the right to do,” the court still had “subject-matter jurisdiction because the threat- eliminating behavior was effectively coerced”
E. holding that the Federal Circuit applies its own law with respect to patent law issues, applies the law of the circuit in which the district court sits to non-patent issues, but not specifying whether subject matter jurisdiction is a patent or non-patent issue

The circuits, however, are divided over the standard for determining whether an alleged misrepresentation is sufficiently related to the purchase or sale of a covered security to satisfy the ""in connection with"" requirement. The Fifth Circuit in this case adopted the Ninth Circuit standard and held that the complaint here was not precluded by SLUSA, expressly rejecting conflicting Second, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuit standards for construing the ""in connection with"" requirement, all of which would result in SLUSA preclusion here.
Whether SLUSA precludes a state-law class action alleging a scheme of fraud that involves misrepresentations about transactions In SLUSA-covered securities.

Here is question: The Federal Impact Aid Program, 20 U.S.C. § 7709, was enacted to subsidize local State school districts which have a federal presence within the district such as military bases or, as in the present case, Indian Reservations. These local districts are not able to tax such federally impacted lands. The Impact Aid Program prohibits the State from counting these federal subsidies as part of an impacted district’s budget when the State allocates operational funds to the local districts, unless the State’s operational funding to districts throughout the State is “equalized” under an equalization formula under the Impact Aid Program. If the State’s operational funding is determined to be “equalized,” the State can reduce operational funding to an impacted district by the amount of the Impact Aid subsidy. In 1994, the equalization formula was statutorily created and effectively repealed the equalization formula previously created by the Secretary of the United States Department of Education by regulation. However, in 1996, the Secretary, by regulation, reinstated his repealed and conflicting equalization formula and refuses to follow Congress’ equalization formula. Under Congress’ formula, New Mexico is not “equalized” and the intended beneficiaries receive the Impact Aid. Under the Secretary’s formula, New Mexico is deemed “equalized” and the Impact Aid is taken from the impacted districts. The impacted districts are losing approximately $50,000,000 per year in Impact Aid. The Tenth Circuit was split 6 to 6 on the question, leaving the Secretary’s formula in effect.
Whether the Secretary has the authority to create and impose his formula over the one prescribed by Congress and through this process certify New Mexico’s operational funding for fiscal year 1999- 2000 as “equalized,” thereby diverting the Impact Aid subsidies to the State and whether this is one of the rare cases where this Court should exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to correct a plain error that affects all State school districts that educate federally connected children.

Here is question: The City and County of San Francisco adopted an ordinance that prohibited hotels from continuing their historic, duly-licensed operation as hotels, but allowed hotel owners to avoid those restrictions by paying an exaction. Petitioners brought this action challenging the exaction based on the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit initially refused to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge, finding that petitioners were required to ripen their claim by seeking compensation in state court under Williamson County Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City. Once the claim was ripe, the Ninth Circuit again refused to reach the merits of the constitutional challenge, finding that the claim was barred by issue preclusion. In reaching that conclusion, the Ninth Circuit held that the California Supreme Courts' refusal to apply heightened scrutiny to legislative exactions under state law is consistent with federal Takings law. The questions presented are:
Is a Fifth Amendment Takings claim barred by issue preclusion based on a judgment denying compensation solely under state law, which was rendered in a state court proceeding that was required to ripen the federal Takings claim?
Options:
A. holding that a federal claim in a state court judgment on which the state court was silent will not be reviewed unless it was properly presented to the state court
B. holding that a federal court presented with a Title VII case should apply state preclusion law when the plaintiff had previously obtained in state court on-the-record review of a state agency's decision on the plaintiff 's discrimination claim
C. holding that where district court granted summary judgment and appellate court affirmed, the appellate court abused its discretion in declining to decide the pendent state law claim because if the affirmative action plan challenged in the case was invalid under state law, there would have been no need to reach the federal constitutional issue
D. holding that the full faith and credit statute encompasses the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion and specifically declining to carve out an exception ""to provide a federal forum for litigants who seek to advance federal takings claims that are not ripe until the entry of a final state judgment denying just compensation""
E. holding that a state statute taking, for the government's own use, the interest accruing on a privately owned interpleader fund deposited in the registry of the county court was unconstitutional under the Takings Clause, and that the state could not avoid the constitutional violation by legislatively or judicially recharacterizing the principal as ""public money""

Here is question: In United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005), this Court held that mandatory application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines violates a criminal defendant’s right under the Sixth Amendment to have facts that increase his or her sentence determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court further held that to avoid the Sixth Amendment violation, the Guidelines are to be applied as advisory only, and as one of a number of factors both that a sentencing court must consider pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3553(a) in exercising its discretion in selecting a sentence and that a court of appeals must consider when reviewing the sentence for reasonableness. In light of the Court’s holdings, the following questions are presented.
In carrying out the mandate of §3553(a) to impose a sentence that is “sufficient but not greater than necessary” on a defendant, may a district court consider either the impact of the so-called “100:1 crack/powder ratio” implemented in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines or the reports and recommendations of the U.S. Sentencing Commission in 1995, 1997, and 2002 regarding the ratio?
Options:
A. holding that sentencing a defendant ""under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts"" violates the Ex Post Facto clause of the United States Constitution if ""the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense""
B. holding that ""a Government motion attesting to the defendant's substantial assistance in a criminal investigation and requesting that the district court depart below the minimum of the applicable sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines"" does not also permit ""the district court to depart below any statutory minimum sentence""
C. holding that application of a revision of Florida's sentencing guidelines applied to a defendant convicted before the legislature passed the guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the new guidelines increased the length of the defendant's punishment

Here is question: Petitioner admitted that she tried to injure her husband's paramour by spreading toxic chemicals on the woman's car and mailbox. Instead of allowing local officials to handle this domestic dispute, the federal prosecutor indicted petitioner under a federal law, 18 U.S.C. § 229(a), enacted by Congress to implement the United States' obligations under a 1993 treaty addressing the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons. Facing a sentence of six years in prison, petitioner challenged the statute and her resulting conviction as exceeding the federal government's enumerated powers and impermissible under the Tenth Amendment. Declining to reach petitioner's constitutional arguments, and in acknowledged conflict with decisions from other courts of appeals, the Third Circuit held that, when the state and its officers are not party to the proceedings, a private party has no standing to challenge the federal statute under which she is convicted as in excess of Congress's enumerated powers and in violation of the Tenth Amendment.
Whether a criminal defendant convicted under a federal statute has standing to challenge her conviction on grounds that, as applied to her, the statute is beyond the federal government's enumerated powers and inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment.

Here is question: Petitioner and Respondent entered into a contract that included a provision that Petitioner is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees incurred in connection with the enforcement, protection, or litigation of its contractual and legal rights. Petitioner incurred attorneys’ fees litigating its rights during the course of Respondent’s bankruptcy case and sought to recover them from Respondent. Adhering to its prior decision in Fobian v. Western Farm Credit Bank (In re Fobian), 951 F.2d 1149 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit held that Petitioner could not recover its attorneys’ fees because the relevant litigation in the bankruptcy court involved issues of federal bankruptcy law. The court reasoned that, as a matter of general federal common law, a party may not recover its attorneys’ fees pursuant to a contract or state statute where the issues litigated involve matters of federal law because only federal law may authorize such a recovery.
Should the Court grant certiorari to resolve a conflict among nine courts of appeals concerning whether a litigant may recover attorneys’ fees under a contract or state statute where the issues litigated involve matters of federal bankruptcy law?
Options:
A. holding that the state code of professional responsibility did not by its own terms apply to attorney sanctions in the federal courts, but that federal courts in exercising their inherent power under the standards imposed by federal law may charge attorneys with the knowledge of, and conformity to, the state codes
B. holding that plaintiff's counsel should recover the percentage of the recovery specified in the contingent-fee agreement because the fee-shifting provision of 42 U.S.C. § 1988 does not ""limit civil rights plaintiffs' freedom to contract with their attorneys""
C. holding that “Section 502(b) disallows any claim that is ‘unenforceable against the debtor ... under any agreement or applicable law’ ...

Here is question: In Duro v. Reina, 495 U.S. 676 (1990), this Court held that Indian Tribes had lost their inherent sovereign power to prosecute members of other Tribes for offenses committed on their reservations. Congress responded to the Court's decision by amending the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, 25 U.S.C. 1301, to ""recognize[] and affirm[]"" the ""inherent power"" of Tribes to ""exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians."" The question presented is:
Whether Section 1301, as amended, validly restores the Tribes' sovereign power to prosecute members of other Tribes (rather than delegates federal prosecutorial power to the Tribes), such that a federal prosecution following a tribal prosecution for an offense with the same elements is valid under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Options:
A. holding that the government had a contractual obligation to pay tribes contract supports costs
B. holding that the Civil Rights Act of 1968 § 201, as amended, 25 U.S.C.A. § 1301, amounted to a federal acknowledgement (as opposed to the source) of the Spirit Lake Tribe's inherent sovereign power to prosecute and punish offenders, thus rendering a Double Jeopardy challenge impermissible
C. holding that Congress, which regulated the introduction of alcoholic beverages in ""Indian country"" could validly delegate to Indian tribes its authority to regulate that subject matter because Indian tribes themselves possessed independent authority over the subject matter
D. holding that an Indian tribe's exercise of criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians is inconsistent with the domestic-dependent status of the tribes and that tribes may not assume such jurisdiction without congressional authorization

In a capital murder case, did the Florida Supreme Court err in (A) finding defense counsel ineffective per se under United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984) despite having found counsel's strategy not to contest overwhelming evidence of guilt but to vigorously contest the sentence in the defendant's best interest and reasonably calculated to avoid a death sentence, and (B) concluding that Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969) prohibited trial counsel from adopting a strategy, after fully informing his client, not to contest overwhelming evidence of guilt to protect the best interest of his client in contesting the appropriateness of imposing the death penalty?
Options:
A. holding that under the Alabama death penalty statute, because the judge did not consider the jury's recommendation, the statute which forced the jury to sentence the defendant to death whenever aggravating circumstances existed was not unconstitutional
B. holding that where penalty phase jury deadlocked on sentence, and trial court imposed default life sentence required by state law, but conviction was later reversed, neither double jeopardy nor due process barred new trial for capital murder with exposure to death penalty

D. holding that counsel's strategic decision, made without the defendant's express consent, to concede, in his opening statement at guilt phase of capital murder trial, the defendant's commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing defendant's life, is not per se prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel

A ""serious drug offense"" is defined in relevant part as ""an offense under State law . . . for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law."" § 924(e)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's classification of Petitioner's North Carolina drug offenses as ""serious drug offenses"" under ACCA, even though at the time of Petitioner's federal sentencing, North Carolina's current sentencing law did not prescribe a maximum term of imprisonment of at least ten years for those state drug offenses. The Fourth Circuit held that since North Carolina did not apply its current sentencing law retroactively, the fact that Petitioner's drug offenses were punishable by imprisonment for at least ten years under the version of the law in effect at the time he committed these offenses qualified them as ""serious drug offenses"" under ACCA.
Whether the plain meaning of ""is prescribed by law"" which ACCA uses to define a predicate ""serious drug offense"" requires a federal sentencing court to look to the maximum penalty prescribed by current state law for a drug offense at the time of the instant federal offense, regardless of whether the state has made that current sentencing law retroactive.

Here is question: Whether a criminal defendant’s “voluntary statement obtained in the absence of a knowing and voluntary waiver of the [Sixth Amendment] right to counsel,” Michigan v. Harvey, 494 U.S. 344, 354 (1990), is admissible for impeachment purposes—a question the Court expressly left open in Harvey and which has resulted in a deep and enduring split of authority in the Circuits and state courts of last resort?
Options:
A. holding that, if a plea is not ""voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void""
B. holding that defendant's statement obtained in violation of Sixth Amendment right to counsel was inadmissible to prove guilt but admissible to impeach defendant's inconsistent testimony
C. holding that ""[a]n express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel is usually strong proof of the validity of that waiver, but is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver.""
D. holding that, where -2- suspect confesses after invoking right to counsel, that confession is admissible if suspect initiates the discussion and totality of circumstances reveals waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent

Here is question: In Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370 (1990), this Court upheld the constitutionality of California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in capital cases, the so-called ""unadorned factor (k),"" which directs juries to consider ""any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."" This Court found jurors would reasonably understand this instruction to encompass mitigating factors unrelated to the crime itself, such as the defendant's background and character. In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the use of this same instruction violated the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution because it likely misled the jurors to believe they were forbidden from considering background and character evidence relating to ""forward-looking"" considerations about the defendant's future prospects if sentenced to life in prison.
Does Boyde confirm the constitutional sufficiency of California's ""unadorned factor (k)"" instruction where a defendant presents mitigating evidence of his background and character which relates to, or has a bearing on, his future prospects as a life prisoner?
Options:
A. holding that individual juror questions regarding instructions, susceptible of differing interpretations, did not justify grant of habeas relief
B. holding that in considering a habeas claim based on an improper jury instruction, the court must ask ""whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process, not merely whether the instruction is undesirable [or] erroneous""
C. holding that evidence that a petitioner has been a well-behaved and well-adjusted prisoner from which the jury could draw favorable inferences regarding the petitioner's character and probable future conduct if sentenced to life in prison is admissible as mitigating evidence
D. holding that the Eighth Amendment required consideration of "" the particular circumstances of [defendant's] crime and aspects of his character and record as mitigating factors""

Under these standards, are officers entitled to qualified immunity where they obtained a facially valid warrant to search for firearms, firearm-related materials, and gang-related items in the residence of a gang member and felon who had threatened to kill his girlfriend and fired a sawed-off shotgun at her, and a district attorney approved the application, no factually on-point case law prohibited the search, and the alleged overbreadth in the warrant did not expand the scope of the search?
Options:
A. holding that the initial illegal entry of the premises did not require the suppression of evidence later obtained in the execution of the search warrant because the warrant affidavit was based only on the information obtained before the illegal entry
B. holding that the officers reasonably believed that the scope of a warrant, which was approved by a prosecutor and issued by a neutral magistrate, was supported by probable cause
C. holding that a subsequent warrant can provide a valid independent source so long as the initial entry did not affect the police’s “decision to seek the warrant” or the judge’s “decision to issue the warrant”

Here is question: In determining that Petitioner was not entitled to equitable tolling to excuse the late filing of his habeas petition, the Eleventh Circuit determined that the reason for the late filing was the 'gross negligence' on part of Petitioner's state-appointed collateral attorney's failure to file the petition in a timely fashion despite repeated instructions from the Petitioner to do so. However, under the new test announced by the Eleventh Circuit in Petitioner's case, no allegation of attorney negligence or failure to meet a lawyer’s standard of care, in the absence of bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, or mental impairment, could ever qualify as an exceptional circumstance warranting equitable tolling.
This Court should grant certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit to determine whether 'gross negligence' by collateral counsel, which directly results in the late filing of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, can qualify as an exceptional circumstance warranting equitable tolling, or whether, in conflict with other circuits, the Eleventh Circuit was proper in determining that factors beyond 'gross negligence' must be established before an extraordinary circumstance can be found that would warrant equitable tolling.
Options:
A. holding that where the statute at issue provided for an additional 60 days to file for good cause shown and Congress had demonstrated an intent to preclude tolling, the 90-day period to file a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court was not subject to equitable tolling
B. holding that where a narrow tolling provision in § 507 provided tolling unavailable under traditional equitable tolling principles, it ""supplement[ed]"" equitable tolling rather than implying its unavailability

It directs that suits may be brought only against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives sovereign immunity. 28 U.S.C. § 2680 (h) of the FTCA excludes some suits, including battery, from its waiver. Subsection 1089 (e) states, ""For purposes of this section, the provisions of section 2680 (h) ... shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a ... wrongful act ... in the performance of medical ... functions .... "" The particular question presented is whether suit may be brought against the United States for battery committed to a civilian by military medical personnel acting within the scope of employment. The broader question raises the same issue for the same and other claims against groups of government employees whose defense would fall under similarly worded statutes. This Court has never addressed these issues.
Whether suit may be brought against the United States for battery committed to a civilian by military medical personnel acting within the scope of employment.

Here is question: Indian tribal courts inherently lack jurisdiction to hear claims between members and nonmembers. In Montana v. U.S., 450 U.S. 544, 565 (1981), this Court identified two narrow exceptions. The first relates to regulation of nonmembers who enter into consensual relationships with the tribe or its members. The second relates to civil authority concerning activity that directly affects the tribe’s political integrity, economic security, health, or welfare. This Court, however, has never upheld tribal-court, civil-adjudicatory jurisdiction over a nonmember defendant under the first Montana exception, and expressly left this question open in Nevada v. Hicks, 533 U.S. 353, 360 (2001). The question presented is:
Whether Indian tribal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate civil tort claims as an “other means” of regulating the conduct of a nonmember bank owning fee-land on a reservation that entered into a private commercial agreement with a member-owned corporation?
Options:
A. holding that the tribe's authority to tax nonmember mining and drilling on tribal land derived from its inherent power to govern and pay for the costs of self-government and stating that such regulations were also within the tribe's inherent power to condition the continued presence of nonmembers on tribal land
B. holding that federal district court had diversity jurisdiction over insurance dispute, but that a federal court may not exercise diversity jurisdiction over a civil dispute relating to reservation affairs before an appropriate Indian tribal court system has had an opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction

Options:

Here is question: Employee benefit plans often cover a participant's medical bills in the event of injury but require that, if the participant obtains compensation from a third party for that injury, he or she reimburse the plan in full. Under Section 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA""), plans may enforce these reimbursement provisions in court by seeking ""appropriate equitable relief” to enforce ""the terms of the plan."" 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(3). Twice in recent years this Court has resolved disputes about how Section 502(a)(3) works in reimbursement actions. In the more recent case, Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical Services, Inc., 547 U.S. 356 (2006), the Court expressly reserved a third question about the provision. The Third Circuit, in its words, has now ""squarely"" answered ""the question that Sereboff left open,"" Pet. App. 9a, and has done so in a way that, as it acknowledged, splits the circuits.
Whether the Third Circuit correctly held-in conflict with the Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits-that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) authorizes courts to use equitable principles to rewrite contractual language and refuse to order participants to reimburse their plan for benefits paid, even where the plan's terms give it an absolute right to full reimbursement.
Options:
A. holding that a contractual right to reimbursement from funds recovered from a third party supported a plan’s action under § 502(a)(3) because the clause established an equitable lien by agreement
B. holding that an ERISA plan fiduciary, bringing action under ERISA § 502, could enforce a lien on monies received by the beneficiary from a third party tortfeasor, reasoning that the lien would serve to hold the fiduciary and beneficiary to their mutual promises pursuant to the governing ERISA plan document
C. holding that ERISA preempted a state anti-subrogation law, the latter of which prohibited an employee welfare benefit plan from requiring reimbursement from a participant that already had recovered from a third party, and noting that preemption served “to ensure that benefit plans will be governed by only a single set of regulations”
D. holding that a participant in a disability plan could not bring suit under § 502 to recover consequential damages arising from delay in the processing of her claim because § 502 ""provid[es] remedies that would protect the entire plan rather than individuals""
E. holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages

Options:
A. holding that attorney abandonment constitutes an extraordinary circumstance that allows a federal court to disregard the state procedural bar to hearing a habeas petition

Here is question: Section 507 of the Bankruptcy Code grants payment priority to some unsecured claims, including claims for certain wages and employee benefits earned before the bankruptcy filing. 11 U.S.C. § 507(a)(4), (5). Such priority claims must be paid in full before other unsecured claims may be paid from estate assets. The debtor in this chapter 11 case agreed to settle a cause of action belonging to the estate. Rather than distributing the settlement proceeds under a confirmed plan of reorganization, the debtor then sought a ""structured dismissal"" of the bankruptcy case. The dismissal order provided that the settlement proceeds would be paid to general unsecured creditors, rather than to petitioners, former employees of the debtor whose claims have priority over those of general unsecured creditors under § 507(a)(4) and (5). The question presented, on which the courts of appeals are divided, is:
Whether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme.
Options:
A. holding that the claims that will have priority in advance of payment to all other creditors are the costs and expenses of administration of the estate
B. holding that a bankruptcy court lacks the authority, absent the consent of affected parties, to order a distribution scheme related to a Chapter 11 dismissal that skips the Bankruptcy Code’s ""basic priority rules"" for ""final distributions of estate value in business bankruptcies""
C. holding that ""it is sensible to view the debtor-in-possession as the same `entity' which existed before the filing of the bankruptcy petition, but empowered by virtue of the Bankruptcy Code to deal with its contracts and property in a manner it could not have employed absent the bankruptcy filing""
D. holding that bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to issue injunction prohibiting execution of supersedeas bond that was not part of the debtor's Chapter 11 bankruptcy estate because bankruptcy court's jurisdiction extends to “more than the simpl[e] proceedings involving the property of the estate”

The question presented here is:
Whether time granted to prepare pretrial motions is excludable under § 3161(h)(1).
Options:
A. holding that filing of a pretrial motion falls within Speedy Trial Act's exclusion irrespective of actual delay in starting trial, and that weekend days and holidays are included in ten-day period of Speedy Trial Act provision excluding delay resulting from transportation of defendant

1. Whether an action brought by a death-sentenced prisoner pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which does not attack a conviction or sentence, is - simply because the person is under a sentence of death - to be treated as a habeas corpus case subject to the restriction on successive petitions which categorically precludes review of any constitutional violation not related to innocence (as the Fourth, Fifth and Eleventh Circuits hold), or can be maintained as § 1983 action (as the Sixth, Eighth and Ninth Circuits and several lower courts hold)?
2. Whether a cut-down procedure which involves pain and mutilation, conducted prior to an execution by lethal injection, violates the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution?
Whether a complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 by a death-sentenced state prisoner, who seeks to stay his execution in order to pursue a challenge to the procedures for carrying out the execution, is properly recharacterized as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254?

The Sixth Circuit recently agreed that spousal guarantors have standing as 'applicants' to assert ECOA violations.

The Eighth Circuit's decision raises the following issues not yet decided by this Court:
Are 'primarily and unconditionally liable' spousal guarantors unambiguously excluded from being ECOA 'applicants' because they are not integrally part of 'any aspect of a credit transaction'?
Options:
A. holding that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law

Here is question: Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the period of time during which a covered employee must be paid begins when the worker engages in a principal activity. Donning and doffing safety gear (including protective clothing) required by the employer is a principal activity when it is an integral and indispensable part of the activities for which the worker is employed. Such requirements are common in manufacturing firms. However, under section 203(o) of the Act an employer need not compensate a worker for time spent in ""changing clothes"" (even if it is a principal activity) if that time is expressly excluded from compensable time under a bona fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to that worker. The interrelated questions presented are:
What constitutes ""changing clothes"" within the meaning of section 203(o)?
Options:
A. holding that such a seizure is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because it is limited in time and scope and justified by the important law enforcement interest in preventing the destruction of evidence during the time necessary to secure a warrant

Here is question: Section 1129(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth three alternative standards for determining if a chapter 11 plan is ""fair and equitable"" with respect to an objecting class of secured creditors. Petitioners, the Debtors, proposed a chapter 11 plan involving the sale of assets free of liens that satisfies one of these standards by providing their secured lender with the ""indubitable equivalent"" of its claim pursuant to Section 1129(b)(2)(A)(iii). In an appeal certified directly from the bankruptcy court, the Seventh Circuit held that the Debtors could only satisfy the statute by allowing their secured creditor to bid its claim in lieu of cash (i.e., credit bid) at the sale pursuant to Section 1129(b )(2)(A)(ii). This holding directly conflicts with the Third Circuit's decision in In re Philadelphia Newspapers, 599 F.3d 298 (3d Cir. 2010), and the Fifth Circuit's decision in Scotia Pacific Co., LLC v.

Whether a debtor may pursue a chapter 11 plan that proposes to sell assets free of liens without allowing the secured creditor to credit bid, but instead providing it with the indubitable equivalent of its claim under Section 1129(b )(2)(A)(iii) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Options:
A. holding that a Chapter 11 cramdown plan that provides for the sale of collateral free and clear of a secured creditor's lien, but does not permit the secured creditor to credit-bid at the sale is not capable of confirmation under the ""fair and equitable"" standard of section 1129(b)

The question presented is whether RFRA allows a for-profit corporation to deny its employees the health coverage of contraceptives to which the employees are otherwise entitled by federal law, based on the religious objections of the corporation's owners.
Options:
A. holding that the sole shareholder of a corporation lacked standing to state a personal § 1981 claim where the defendant allegedly breached its contract with the corporation, because ""the shareholder and contracting officer of a corporation has no rights and is exposed to no liability under the corporation's contracts""
B. holding that the government may not burden conduct motivated by a sincerely held religious belief unless the government acts by the least restrictive means to further a compelling state interest
C. holding that the government had not shown that the contraceptive mandate at issue was the least restrictive alternative to providing contraceptive coverage to women because “HHS ha[d] not provided any estimate of the average cost per employee of providing access to ... contraceptives.”

Here is question: Through passage of the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-353, 112 Stat. 3227 (""SLUSA ""), Congress, inter alia, amended Section 28 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to preempt any private action brought on behalf of 50 or more persons from proceeding under the statutory or common law of any State in any state or federal court if such action alleges ""[a] misrepresentation or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security."" 15 U.S.C. § 78bb(f)(1)(A), (5)(B). In Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975), this Court adopted a ""purchaser-seller"" standing limitation in private actions brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), by requiring the private plaintiff to be an actual purchaser or seller. The decision below implicates whether that judicially crafted ""purchaser-seller"" standing requirement articulated as a limit on private fraud actions under Section 10(b) applies to limit SLUSA's broad preemptive scope over state law claims. The question presented in this petition is:
Whether, as the Seventh Circuit held earlier this month and in direct conflict with the decision below, SLUSA preempts state law class action claims based upon allegedly fraudulent statements or omissions brought solely on behalf of persons who were induced thereby to hold or retain (and not purchase or sell) securities?
Options:
A. holding that only a statutory ""seller"" may be liable under § 12 of Securities Act
B. holding that this issue is governed by Section 2 of the Securities Act and Section 3 of the Exchange Act, both of which define the term ""security"" to include ""any note.""
C. holding that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act preempts state law holder claims brought as class actions because a “holder class action ... is distinguishable from a typical Rule 10b–5 class action in only one respect: [i]t is brought by holders instead of purchasers or sellers,” which is an “irrelevant” distinction in this context
D. holding that the Supreme Court’s implication of a private right of action under § 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 was simply acquiescence in ""the 25-year-old acceptance by the lower federal courts of an implied action""

Here is question: The district court found a likelihood that the Navy failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and preliminarily enjoined the Navy’s use of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar during training exercises that prepare Navy strike groups for worldwide deployment. The Chief of Naval Operations concluded that the injunction unacceptably risks the training of naval forces for deployment to high-threat areas overseas, and the President of the United States determined that the use of MFA sonar during these exercises is “essential to national security.” The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), applying a longstanding regulation, accordingly found “emergency circumstances” for complying with NEPA without completing an environmental impact statement. The Ninth Circuit nevertheless sustained the district court’s conclusion that no “emergency circumstances” were present and affirmed the preliminary injunction. The questions presented are:
Whether CEQ permissibly construed its own regulation in finding “emergency circumstances.”
Options:
A. holding that NEPA does not require the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to evaluate the environmental effects of cross-border motor carrier operations because the agency lacked the discretion to prevent those operations

Here is question: For more than 25 years, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held that a legal permanent resident (LPR) who is deportable due to a criminal conviction could seek a discretionary waiver of removal under Section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. §1182(c), provided that the conviction also would have constituted a waivable basis for exclusion. In 2005, the BIA abruptly changed course, adding a requirement that the LPR be deportable under a statutory provision that used ""similar language"" to an exclusion provision. Deportable LPRs who departed and reentered the United States after their conviction, however, may seek Section 212(c) relief under a longstanding ""nunc pro tunc"" procedure that does not turn on similar language between deportation and exclusion provisions. Thus, under the BIA's current view, an LPR who pled guilty to an offense that renders him both deportable and excludable, but under provisions that use dissimilar phrasing, will be eligible for Section 212(c) relief from deportation if he departed and reentered the United States after his conviction, but ineligible if he did not depart. The circuits are split three ways on the lawfulness of the BIA's new interpretation.
Whether a lawful permanent resident who was convicted by guilty plea of an offense that renders him deportable and excludable under differently phrased statutory subsections, but who did not depart and reenter the United States between his conviction and the commencement of removal proceedings, is categorically foreclosed from seeking discretionary relief from removal under former Section 212(c) of the INA.
Options:
A. holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”

Here is question: Section 319 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 created the so-called “Millionaires’ Amendment.” The three-judge district court found that Congress enacted section 319 to achieve equity between congressional candidates utilizing personal funds for their campaigns and candidates relying mainly on contributed funds. Under the statute, when candidates for the United States House of Representatives exceed $350,000 in personal campaign expenditures their opponents may be entitled to receive: 1) contributions from donors at triple the statutory limit; 2) contributions from donors who have reached their statutory limit for aggregate campaign donations; and 3) coordinated expenditures from party committees in excess of the statutory limit. To effectuate application of section 319, the statute also imposes significant notification and disclosure obligations upon self- financed candidates. The questions presented are:
Whether the three-judge district court erred in finding that Congress’s attempt to equalize a potential imbalance in resources between congressional candidates violates neither the First Amendment to the United States Constitution nor the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

Here is question: This interpleader action was brought to settle ownership of assets misappropriated by Ferdinand Marcos when he was President of the Republic of the Philippines. The assets are claimed both by the Republic, which under Philippine law is the owner of property acquired though the misuse of public office by Philippine officials, and by a class of private judgment creditors of the Marcos estate. The Republic was dismissed from the action on sovereign immunity grounds. In the Republic’s absence, however, the district court held that the Republic is not an indispensable party to the action under Fed. R. Civ.

Here is question: In Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997), this Court held that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) (28 U.S.C. § 2241, etseq.) did not apply to cases which commenced prior to the AEDPA ' s April 24, 1996, effective date. The circuits are split as to when a capital case commences for purposes of triggering the AEDPA. With one exception, all the circuits to consider the issue have found the AEDPA applies if the actual petition was filed on or after the AEDPA's effective date. However, in the Ninth Circuit, the AEDPA does not apply to a federal petition filed on or after April 24, 1996, if motions for appointment of counsel and stay of execution were filed before that date. Calderon v. United States District Court (Kelly), 163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc ).
What is the correct trigger event for the application of the AEDPA in capital cases?
Options:
A. holding that an amendment to a criminal statute did not apply retroactively to offenses committed prior to the effective date of the amendment, even though the defendants were sentenced after that date
B. holding that there was no due process violation under AEDPA where the challenged jury instruction ""parroted the language of the statute""
C. holding that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) did not deprive district courts of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 over legal questions raised by criminal aliens in habeas petitions seeking review of final removal orders
D. holding that whether the AEDPA governs depends on whether the petitioner had filed an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits prior to AEDPA's effective date
E. holding that, if legislation includes a provision that expressly applies to cases pending on the date of enactment and another provision that does not, the construction “indicat[es] implicitly” that the latter applies only to cases filed after the date of enactment

Options:
A. holding that petitioner did not have a ""constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment"" and that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during state habeas appellate proceedings does not constitute cause to excuse the procedural defects
B. holding a petitioner arguing ineffective assistance by his appellate counsel must establish both his appellate counsel's performance was objectively unreasonable and there is a reasonable probability that, but for appellate counsel's objectively unreasonable conduct, the petitioner would have prevailed on appeal
C. holding that to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that ""counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness"" and ""there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different""

Respondents are United States persons who may not be targeted for surveillance under Section 1881a. Respondents filed this action on the day that Section 1881a was enacted, seeking both a declaration that Section 1881a is unconstitutional and an injunction permanently enjoining any foreign-intelligence surveillance from being conducted under Section 1881a. The question presented is:
Whether respondents lack Article III standing to seek prospective relief because they proffered no evidence that the United States would imminently acquire their international communications using Section 1881a-authorized surveillance and did not show that an injunction prohibiting Section 1881a-authorized surveillance would likely redress their purported injuries.

The question presented is:
Do these state no-surcharge laws unconstitutionally restrict speech conveying price information (as the Eleventh Circuit has held), or do they regulate economic conduct (as the Second and Fifth Circuits have held)?
Options:
A. holding that an “agreement to terminate the practice of giving credit” is appropriately characterized as a price-fixing agreement because “[i]t is virtually self-evident that extending interest-free credit for a period of time is equivalent to giving a discount equal to the value of the use of the purchase price for that period of time”

Options:
A. holding that once defendant has been convicted fairly in guilt phase of capital trial, presumption of innocence disappears; ""presumption [of innocence] operates at the guilt phase of a trial to remind the jury that the State has the burden of establishing every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt""
B. holding that the state court's exclusion of evidence probative of the credibility of the defendant's confession because the proffered evidence was also relevant to voluntariness, an issue the court had already ruled on, violated the defendant's right to a fair trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments

Here is question: A single element missing or misdefined in jury instructions can be harmless error if, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error did not contribute to the verdict. Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1 (1999). In contrast, errors that affect the entire framework within which a trial proceeds, rather than errors in the trial process itself, are ""structural"" and will always invalidate a conviction. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275 (1993). It is undisputed in this assault case that the only weapon used was a firearm, but the verdict form for the enhancement failed to distinguish a ""firearm"" finding from a more generic ""deadly weapon"" finding -- the ""firearm"" finding carries a greater sentence.

App. P. 4(b)(2) allows that ""[a] notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence or order - but before entry of the judgment - is treated as filed on the date of and after entry."" The rule incorporates this Court's decision in Lemke v. United States, 346 U.S. 325 (1953) (per curiam) and decisions of the circuits that a premature notice of appeal matures or springs forward when the judgment under review is entered. The interaction of this rule with deferred restitution judgments has become a source of circuit conflict, particularly following this Court's decision in Dolan v.

Here is question: The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (""ADA"") includes a preemption provision providing that States ""may not enact or enforce a law, regulation or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier."" 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b). Respondent was a participant in Northwest Airlines' frequent flyer program, which by its terms permitted Northwest to remove participants from the program in Northwest's ""sole judgment."" After respondent was removed from the frequent flyer program, he filed suit against Northwest alleging, inter alia, that Northwest breached both its contractual obligations and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Minnesota law when it exercised its discretion to terminate respondent's membership in the program. Although the district court dismissed the contract claim for failure to state a claim and the implied covenant of good faith claim as preempted by the ADA, the Ninth Circuit reversed as to the implied covenant claim, finding such claims categorically unrelated to a price, route or service under a line of Ninth Circuit cases that have been recognized by other Circuits as inconsistent with this Court's precedents, especially American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219 (1995). The question presented is:
Did the court of appeals err by holding, in conflict with the decisions of other Circuits, that respondent's implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim was not preempted under the ADA because such claims are categorically unrelated to a price, route, or service, notwithstanding that respondent's claim arises out of a frequent flyer program (the precise context of Wolens) and manifestly enlarged the terms of the parties' voluntary undertakings, which allowed termination in Northwest's sole discretion.
Options:
A. holding that the Airline Deregulation Act preempted claims alleging breach of an implied covenant because, under the controlling state law, parties could not contract out of such covenants—and thus they were “regarded as state-imposed”—but noting that if a state permitted parties to voluntarily surrender protections from covenants, then those claims would “escape preemption”
B. holding that an anonymous informant's ""ability to predict respondent's future behavior""—namely, the route that respondent would take to deliver a package of cocaine—""demonstrated inside information a special familiarity with respondent's affairs,"" and thus rendered the informant's tip sufficiently reliable—although it was a ""close case""

The Ninth Circuit in this case has held that a local regulation may impose such restrictions on new vehicle purchases. The question presented is:
Whether local government regulations prohibiting the purchase of new motor vehicles with specified emission characteristics--which are otherwise approved for sale by state and federal regulators--are preempted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.
Options:
A. holding that rules requiring local fleet operators to purchase or lease only vehicles that met state motor vehicle pollution standards were related to controlling emissions and were preempted by the CAA
B. holding that law enforcement officers' decision to pull over specific vehicles on suspicion of drug trafficking was clearly justified at its inception based on those vehicles' characteristics and driving patterns; analyzing whether investigative stop was ""too long in duration"" under the reasonably-related-in-scope prong
C. holding that, with respect to the plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees in the plaintiff's action under the Clean Air Act, ""absent some degree of success on the merits by the claimant, it is not `appropriate' for a federal court to award attorney's fees under § 307(f) [of the Clean Air Act]""

Whether allegations of inadequacies in a monopolist's affirmative assistance to its rivals, including resellers--as newly provided by incumbent local telephone companies under the Telecommunications Act of 1996--state a claim for unlawful unilateral predatory conduct under Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
2. Whether antitrust and Communications Act standing extends to indirect purchasers, i.e., the customers of the defendant's customer, asserting injuries wholly derivative of the direct customer's injury, even when invoking only the direct customer's legal rights.
Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the District Court's dismissal of respondent's antitrust claims?
Options:
A. holding that plaintiff must show antitrust injury, meaning injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and which flows from defendant's unlawful acts
B. holding that mailboxes, although paid for by the customer, are an essential part of the Postal Service for purposes of forum analysis
C. holding that a telephone customer had no legitimate expectation of privacy in telephone numbers he had dialed because in dialing he voluntarily conveyed the information to the telephone company and thereby assumed the risk that the telephone company would disclose it
D. holding that a firm with no antitrust duty to deal with its rivals at all is under no obligation to provide those rivals with a ""sufficient"" level of service

Here is question: Whether the erroneous denial of a criminal defendant’s peremptory challenge that resulted in the challenged juror being seated requires automatic reversal of a conviction because it undermines the trial structure for preserving the constitutional right to due process and an impartial jury.
Options:
A. holding that misconduct by a prosecutor in a state criminal trial violates the right to due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment only where the remark ""by itself so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.""
B. holding that even though trial court erred in qualifying a juror, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated because he had to use a peremptory challenge to excuse the juror, stating, ""we reject the notion that the loss of a peremptory challenge constitutes a violation of the constitutional right to an impartial jury""
C. holding that the Due Process Clause does not require strict observance of state procedural rules
D. holding peremptory challenges are not constitutionally protected rights but, rather, one means to achieve a constitutionally required impartial jury and a prohibition on the use of peremptory challenges does not impair the constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and fair trial

Here is question: Under the Fourth Amendment's objective reasonableness test, an arrest is deemed ""reasonable"" if there is probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred. Two judicial circuits find an arrest reasonable if, based on an objective assessment by a reasonable officer, there is probable cause to arrest for any offense. On the other hand, at least five judicial circuits find an arrest to be reasonable only if there is probable cause to arrest for crimes ""closely related"" to the crime or crimes articulated by the arresting officer. This case presents the following questions:
Does an arrest violate the Fourth Amendment when a police officer has probable cause to make an arrest for one offense, if that offense is not closely related to the offense articulated by the officer at the time of the arrest?
Options:
A. holding that under the ""search incident to arrest"" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, "" custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment; that intrusion being lawful, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.""
B. holding that an arrest supported by probable cause and following a traffic stop did not violate the Fourth Amendment because of police officer's subjective motivation to search vehicle for evidence of crime
C. holding that officers were entitled to qualified immunity on retaliatory arrest claim because ""at the time of [plaintiff's] arrest, it was not clearly established that an arrest supported by probable cause could violate the First Amendment""
D. holding that the search-incident-to-a-lawful-arrest rule does not apply to a warrantless search that provides the probable cause for the subsequent arrest because one cannot justify the arrest by the search and then simultaneously justify the search by the arrest
E. holding that when the facts known to the officer provide probable cause to arrest for an offense, the officer’s “subjective reason for making the arrest need not be the criminal offense as to which the known facts provide probable cause”

Here is question: In Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. 343, 357 (1988), this Court held that district courts could remand removed claims upon deciding not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). However, in Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Servs., Inc., 127 S. Ct. 2411, 2416 (2007), the Court stated that “it is far from clear . . . that when discretionary supplemental jurisdiction is declined the remand is not based on lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for purposes of § 1447(c) and § 1447(d)” and noted that “[w]e have never passed on whether Cohill remands are subject-matter jurisdictional for purposes of post-1988 versions § 1447(c) and § 1447(d).” Construing Powerex as leaving the question open, the Federal Circuit held that a remand based on declining supplemental jurisdiction can be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, thus disagreeing with the nine other federal courts of appeals that have construed Cohill as distinguishing between remands for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and remands based on declining to exercise subject matter jurisdiction that already exists. Thus, this petition presents the question posed but left unanswered in Powerex that is now the subject of a direct conflict among the circuits:
Whether a district court’s order remanding a case to state court following its discretionary decision to decline to exercise the supplemental jurisdiction accorded to federal courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c) is properly held to be a remand for a “lack of subject matter jurisdiction” under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c) so that such remand order is barred from any appellate review by 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d).
Options:
A. holding that, although the claims over which the court had original jurisdiction had been dismissed, the court retained supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims; the decision to relinquish jurisdiction over those claims was therefore discretionary and not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction
B. holding that a court may enter an order that personal jurisdiction is deemed established as a sanction under Rule 37(b); Court distinguishes subject matter jurisdiction
C. holding that Social Security administrative proceedings held on remand from a district court order ""are an integral part of the `civil action' for judicial review,"" and thus that attorney's fees for representation on remand are available under the civil action provisions of the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2412
D. holding that, just because there was subject matter jurisdiction, it did not mean ""that the District Court properly could reach the merits"" because ""there remain[ed] the question of equitable jurisdiction""
E. holding that where ""a court does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the underlying action, and the process was not issued in aid of determining that jurisdiction, then the process is void.""

Here is question: In Stern v. Marshall, 131 S. Ct. 2594 (2011), this Court held that Article III of the United States Constitution precludes Congress from assigning certain ""core"" bankruptcy proceedings involving private state law rights to adjudication by non-Article III bankruptcy judges. Applying Stern, the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that a fraudulent conveyance action is subject to Article III. The court further held, in conflict with the Sixth Circuit, that the Article III problem had been waived by petitioner's litigation conduct, which the court of appeals construed as implied consent to entry of final judgment by the bankruptcy court. The court of appeals also held, in conflict with the Seventh Circuit, that a bankruptcy court may issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, subject to a district court's de novo review, in ""core"" bankruptcy proceedings where Article III precludes the bankruptcy court from entering final judgment. The court of appeals' decision presents the following questions, about which there is considerable confusion in the lower courts in the wake of Stern:
Whether Article III permits the exercise of the judicial power of the United States by bankruptcy courts on the basis of litigant consent, and, if so, whether ""implied consent"" based on a litigant's conduct, where the statutory scheme provides the litigant no notice that its consent is required, is sufficient to satisfy Article III.
Options:
A. holding that bankruptcy courts, as non- Article III forums, cannot issue final decisions on state common law counterclaims
B. holding that when considering Stern claims, i.e., those that are statutorily defined as core proceedings, but which must be adjudicated by an Article III court, ""[t]he bankruptcy court should hear the proceeding and submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for de novo review and entry of judgment""
C. holding that the first step is to ""address the jurisdictional question whether [respondent] has standing under Article III of the Constitution to maintain this suit""
D. holding that where every Article III judge had an interest in the outcome of the case, the common law rule of necessity prevailed
E. holding that, unlike state courts, ""[f]ederal courts are not courts of general jurisdiction; they have only the power that is authorized by Article III of the Constitution and the statutes enacted by Congress pursuant thereto""

Here is question: Jack Phillips is a cake artist. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that he engaged in sexual orientation discrimination under the Colorado Anti Discrimination Act (""CADA'') when he declined to design and create a custom cake honoring a same sex marriage because doing so conflicts with his sincerely held religious beliefs. The Colorado Court of Appeals found no violation of the Free Speech or Free Exercise Clauses because it deemed Phillips' speech to be mere conduct compelled by a neutral and generally applicable law. It reached this conclusion despite the artistry of Phillips' cakes and the Commission's exemption of other cake artists who declined to create custom cakes based on their message. This analysis (1) flouts this Court's controlling precedent, (2) conflicts with Ninth and Eleventh Circuit decisions regarding the free speech protection of art, (3) deepens an existing conflict between the Second, Third, Sixth, and Eleventh Circuits as to the proper test for identifying expressive conduct, and (4) conflicts with free exercise rulings by the Third, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits.
Whether applying Colorado's public accommodations law to compel Phillips to create expression that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs about marriage violates the Free Speech or Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment.

Here is question: By statute and this Court's caselaw, a state prisoner must exhaust available state court remedies on direct appeal or through collateral proceedings before a federal court may consider granting habeas corpus relief. This Court has held that exhaustion requires a state prisoner to fairly present his claim to the state's highest court and that fair presentment requires the prisoner to have alerted the state court that the claim is a federal one.
Does a state prisoner ""alert"" the State's highest court that he is raising a federal claim when - in that court - he neither cites a specific provision of the federal constitution nor cites at least one authority that has decided the claim on a federal basis?
Options:
A. holding that to fairly present a federal claim to a state court for exhaustion purposes, petitioners must alert the state court ""to the fact that the prisoners are asserting claims under the United States Constitution""
B. holding that the question to be decided by a federal court on habeas corpus is not whether the state committed state-law error, but rather, whether the state court's action was ""so arbitrary and capricious"" as to constitute an independent violation of the federal constitution
C. holding that a federal claim in a state court judgment on which the state court was silent will not be reviewed unless it was properly presented to the state court

Here is question: Petitioner Arkansas Game & Fish Commission, a constitutional entity of the State of Arkansas, sought just compensation from the United States under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment for physically taking its bottomland hardwood timber through six consecutive years of protested flooding during the sensitive growing season. The Court of Federal Claims awarded $5.7 million, finding that the Army Corps of Engineers' actions foreseeably destroyed and degraded more than 18 million board feet of timber, left habitat unable to regenerate, and preempted Petitioner's use and enjoyment. The Federal Circuit, with its unique jurisdiction over takings claims, reversed the trial judgment on a single point of law. Contrary to this Court's precedent, a sharply divided 2-1 panel ruled that the United States did not inflict a taking because its actions were not permanent and the flooding eventually stopped. The Federal Circuit denied rehearing en banc in a fractured 7-4 vote. The question presented is:
Whether government actions that impose recurring flood invasions must continue permanently to take property within the meaning of the Takings Clause.
Options:
A. holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

C. holding that a state statute taking, for the government's own use, the interest accruing on a privately owned interpleader fund deposited in the registry of the county court was unconstitutional under the Takings Clause, and that the state could not avoid the constitutional violation by legislatively or judicially recharacterizing the principal as ""public money""
D. holding that temporary flooding caused by the Corps of Engineers’ operation of a dam could potentially be compensable through the Takings Clause

Here is question: When a witness in a criminal case identifies a suspect out-of-court, under suggestive circumstances which give rise to a substantial likelihood of later misidentification, due process requires the trial judge to determine whether the out-of-court identification and any subsequent in-court identification are reliable before either may be admitted into evidence. Question:

Here is question: Prescription drug records, which contain information about patients, doctors, and medical treatment, exist because of federal and state regulation in this highly regulated field. This case is about information from prescription records known as ""prescriber-identifiable data."" Such data identifies the doctor or other prescriber, links the doctor to a particular prescription, and reveals other details about that prescription. Pharmacies sell this information to data mining companies, and the data miners aggregate and package the data for use as a marketing tool by pharmaceutical manufacturers. The law at issue in this case, Vermont's Prescription Confidentiality Law, affords prescribers the right to consent before information linking them to prescriptions for particular drugs can be sold or used for marketing. The Second Circuit held that Vermont's law violates the First Amendment, a holding that conflicts with two recent decisions of the First Circuit upholding similar laws.

After 30 years of regulating new facilities, the Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") promulgated a regulation requiring existing cooling water intake structures to be retrofitted to comply with EPA’s latest determination of the ""best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact,"" measured in terms of the potential effects on early life stages of fish. The Second Circuit, deferring to EPA, held that EPA has authority to retrofit existing facilities.

The questions presented, all of which implicate splits in circuit court authority, are:
Whether Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1326(b), authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to compare costs with benefits in determining the ""best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact"" at cooling water intake structures.

BRG of Ga., Inc., 498 U.S. 46, 49-50 (1990). This case concerns agreements between (1) the manufacturer of a brand -name drug on which the manufacturer assertedly holds a patent, and (2) potential generic competitors who, in response to patent-infringement litigation brought against them by the manufacturer, defended on the grounds that their products would not infringe the patent and that the patent was invalid. The patent litigation culminated in a settlement through which the seller of the brand-name drug agreed to pay its would-be generic competitors tens of millions of dollars annually, and those competitors agreed not to sell competing generic drugs for a number of years. Settlements containing that combination of terms are commonly known as ""reverse payment"" agreements.
Whether reverse-payment agreements are per se lawful unless the underlying patent litigation was a sham or the patent was obtained by fraud (as the court below held), or instead are presumptively anticompetitive and unlawful (as the Third Circuit has held).

B. holding agency's issuance of an administrative complaint was not subject to review until final agency action despite its evident assumption that the propriety of the initial charging decision would not be subject to administrative review

Here is question: This Court held in McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), a public corruption case, that the mail fraud statute could not be used to prosecute schemes to deprive the citizenry of the intangible right to good government. Congress responded in 1988 by enacting 18 U.S.C. § 1346, which expands the definition of a ""scheme or artifice to defraud"" under the mail and wire fraud statutes to encompass schemes that ""deprive another of the intangible right of honest services."" Twenty years later, the courts of appeals are hopelessly divided on the application of Section 1346 to purely private conduct. In this case, the Seventh Circuit disagreed with at least five other circuits and held that Section 1346 may be applied in a purely private setting irrespective of whether the defendant's conduct risked any foreseeable economic harm to the putative victim. In the alternative, the Seventh Circuit ruled that the defendants forfeited their objection to the improper instructions by opposing the government's bid to have the jury return a ""special verdict,"" a procedure not contemplated by the criminal rules and universally disfavored by other circuits as prejudicial to a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights.
Whether 18 U.S.C. § 1346 applies to the conduct of a private individual whose alleged ""scheme to defraud"" did not contemplate economic or other property harm to the private party to whom honest services were owed.
Options:
A. holding that while the Due Process Clause of the Constitution protects the right of two individuals of the same sex to engage in mutually consensual private sexual conduct, the case did ""not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.""
B. holding that ""[o]nly if the mailings were `a part of the execution of the fraud,' or...were `incident to an essential part of the scheme,' do they fall within the ban of the federal mail fraud statute""
C. holding that unlike conventional fraud, ""in which the victim's loss of money or property supplied the defendant's gain,"" honest services fraud is targeted at corruption that lacks such symmetry, in which the ""offender profited but the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property""
D. holding that ""§ 1346(b)'s reference to the `law of the place' means law of the State — the source of substantive liability under the FTCA"" such that ""the United States simply has not rendered itself liable under § 1346(b) for constitutional tort claims""

Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168 (1986), this Court held that a state trial judge may, without setting forth any explicit findings or conclusions, remove a juror for cause when the judge determines the juror’s views on the death penalty would substantially impair his or her ability to follow the law and perform the duties of a juror. The Court further held that a federal habeas court reviewing the decision to remove the juror must defer to the trial judge’s ability to observe the juror’s demeanor and credibility, and apply the statutory presumption of correctness to the judge’s implicit factual determination of the juror’s substantial impairment.
Did the Ninth Circuit err by not deferring to the trial judge’s observations and by not applying the statutory presumption of correctness in ruling that the state court decision to remove a juror was contrary to clearly established federal law?
Options:
A. holding that juror's answers ""on their face"" permitted trial court to strike juror for cause, when juror ""stated six times that he could consider the death penalty or follow the law"" but interspersed those statements with ""more equivocal"" ones about how he would have to give it ""some thought""
B. holding that the presumption of correctness under former habeas statute applies to ""factual determinations made by state courts, whether the court be a trial court or appellate court""

Here is question: Petitioners are the owners of 31 residential real estate parcels in Indianapolis, Indiana, who were assessed approximately $9,000 each for connection to a public sewer system. Petitioners paid their assessments in full, while their neighbors-owners of approximately 150 other parcels-elected to pay in monthly installments over 10, 20, or 30 years. Shortly thereafter, the City adopted a new assessment scheme that vastly reduced each taxpayer's burden. The City forgave the outstanding balances of those taxpayers who were paying in installments, but it refused to refund payments made by those who had already paid in full. The Indiana Supreme Court-in conflict with decisions of a federal court holding the very same conduct unconstitutional and other state high courts-held that this action did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, even though it allowed the City to retain from each petitioner 30 times as much in assessed taxes as identically situated owners paid. In so holding, the 3-2 majority of the Indiana Supreme Court dismissed this Court's unanimous decision in Allegheny Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. County Commission, 488 U.S. 336 (1989), as ""narrowed to its facts."" App. 28a.

B. holding that a DUI offense did not have “as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another” under the “crime of violence” definition of 18 U.S.C. § 16 because it could be committed negligently or accidentally

Here is question: The Medicaid Act requires participating States to seek reimbursement from third-party tortfeasors for health-care expenditures they made to Medicaid recipients who are tort victims. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(25), 1396k(a) (2006). To enforce that requirement when the recipient and a third-party resolve their tort dispute through judgment or settlement, North Carolina law provides that the State has a subrogation right to, and may assert a lien upon, the lesser of one-third of the recipient's recovery or the State's actual medical expenditures. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-57 (2011).
The question presented is whether N.C. Gen. Stat. § 108A-57 is preempted by the Medicaid Act's anti-lien provision as it was construed in Arkansas Department of Health & Human Services v. Ahlborn, 547 U.S. 268 (2006), an issue on which the North Carolina Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit are in conflict.

Does defense counsel in a capital case violate the requirements of Strickland v.

Taylor and as most Courts of Appeals have concluded, or is defense counsel's decision not to investigate such evidence ""virtually unchallengeable"" so long as counsel knows rudimentary facts about the defendant's background, as the Fourth Circuit held in this case.
Options:
A. holding that a decision to afford an individual defendant mercy does not violate the Constitution so long as “the decision to impose it [is] guided by standards so that the sentencing authority [will] focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.”

Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742 (1998), this Court held that under Title VII, an employer is vicariously liable for severe or pervasive workplace harassment by a supervisor of the victim. If the harasser was the victim's co-employee, however, the employer is not liable absent proof of negligence. In the decision below, the Seventh Circuit held that actionable harassment by a person whom the employer deemed a ""supervisor"" and who had the authority to direct and oversee the victim's daily work could not give rise to vicarious liability because the harasser did not also have the power to take formal employment actions against her. The question presented is:
Whether, as the Second, Fourth, and Ninth Circuits have held, the Faragher and Ellerth ""supervisor"" liability rule (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victim's daily work, or, as the First, Seventh, and Eighth Circuits have held (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to ""hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline"" their victim.
Options:
A. holding that a plaintiff alleging a harassment claim must show that ""the workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive work environment""

Out-of-state wineries may also petition the State Liquor Control Commission for an order permitting them to ship wine directly to consumers in the State. Any denial of such a request may be appealed through the State court system. Section 2 of the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution expressly prohibits importation of alcoholic beverages into any state for delivery or use, in violation of the laws of the State. The Court of Appeals declared Michigan's alcoholic liquor importation law facially unconstitutional in violation of the Commerce Clause. The question presented is:
Does Michigan's regulation of the importation of beverage alcohol under the 21st Amendment facially violate the Commerce Clause when it permits in-state licensed wineries to directly ship alcohol to consumers, but requires out-of-state wineries to import its products through licensed in-state wholesalers and to sell its products through licensed retailers or request permission of the Liquor Control Commission to bypass this distribution system and ship directly to consumers?
Options:
A. holding that the operation of the regulatory scheme enforced by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board does not sufficiently implicate the State in the discriminatory guest policies of Moose Lodge to make the latter ""state action"" within the ambit of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

C. holding that in-state liquor wholesalers had standing to raise a dormant Commerce Clause challenge to a Hawaii tax regime exempting certain alcohols produced in-state from liquor taxes because the tax raised the price of the imported goods they sold relative to the exempted in-state beverages

Whether the court below erroneously held, in conflict with the decisions of three other circuits, that a shareholder's claim that the fund's investment adviser charged an excessive fee - more than twice the fee it charged to funds with which it was not affiliated - is not cognizable under §36(b), unless the shareholder can show that the adviser misled the fund's directors who approved the fee.
Options:
A. holding that association of investment companies had standing to challenge regulation authorizing banks to operate collective investment funds

Missouri, this Court established a three-prong standard for determining whether a defendant was able to demonstrate a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. The circuits have split on the issue about the proper test for determining what constitutes a fair and reasonable representation of a distinct group from the community within the venires (jury pool) under the second prong of Duren. The Michigan Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the small disparities at issue here for African Americans (7.28% in the community as against 6% in the venires during the time period measured) did not give rise to a constitutional violation.

Grokster, Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 937, 125 S. Ct. 2764, 2780, 162 L. Ed. 2d 781, 801 (2005)?

The question presented is whether, in such a declaratory judgment action brought by a licensee under Medlmmune, the licensee has the burden to prove that its products do not infringe the patent, or whether (as is the case in all other patent litigation, including other declaratory judgment actions), the patentee must prove infringement.
Options:
A. holding that, where a patent licensee threatened with a lawsuit for patent infringement files a declaratory judgment action, the burden of proving infringement remains on the patentee, rather than shifting to the licensee to prove non-infringement
B. holding that the Federal Circuit applies its own law with respect to patent law issues, applies the law of the circuit in which the district court sits to non-patent issues, but not specifying whether subject matter jurisdiction is a patent or non-patent issue
C. holding that an appellate court's affirmance of a finding of non-infringement is not per se a sufficient reason for vacating a declaratory judgment holding the patent invalid, but distinguishing between “[a]n unnecessary ruling on an affirmative defense” and “the necessary resolution of a counterclaim for a declaratory judgment”

Here is question: Federal regulations require petitioner telephone companies to make certain payments to the owners of payphones (“payphone service providers” or “PSPs”). This case arises from the PSPs’ assignments to other companies - respondents here - of the right to litigate their dispute with petitioners over the amount of compensation. After the PSPs assigned their claims to respondents “for purposes of collection” and agreed to finance the litigation, respondents sued petitioners “on behalf of” the PSPs. Under the assignments, respondents can gain or lose nothing from the outcome of the case because all the proceeds will go to the PSPs. A divided panel of the D.C. Circuit nonetheless held that respondents have standing to sue petitioners. The question presented is:
Whether the assignment of a claim “for purposes of collection” confers standing on assignees which have no personal stake in the case and which avowedly litigate only “on behalf of” the assignors.
Options:
A. holding that an assignee of a legal claim for money retained standing to sue in federal court when that assignee had promised to give all litigation proceeds back to the assignor because ""most state courts entertained suits virtually identical to"" the suit before the Court throughout the nineteenth century
B. holding that ""the [d]istrict [c]ourt's entry of judgment in favor of named plaintiffs over their objections did not moot their private case or controversy, and that respondents' individual interest in the litigation . . . is sufficient to permit their appeal of the adverse certification ruling"" (emphasis and footnote omitted)
C. holding that “the Fifth Amendment does not require the Government to pay for that element of value based on the use of respondents’ fee lands in combination with the Government’s permit lands”
D. holding that petitioners challenging Penfield, New York, zoning ordinance lacked standing because the evidence showed “that their inability to reside in Penfield is the consequence of the economics of the area housing market, rather than of respondents’ assertedly illegal acts.”

Id. At 792.  The prayers in Marsh were offered for sixteen years by the same paid Presbyterian minister and frequently contained explicitly Christian themes.  See id. at 785, 793 n.14. Nonetheless, this Court held that such prayers are ""simply a tolerable acknowledgment of beliefs widely held among the people of this country,"" and constitutional unless the selection of prayer-givers ""stem[s] from an impermissible motive"" or ""the prayer opportunity has been exploited to proselytize or advance any one, or to disparage any other, faith or belief.""

In this case, the court of appeals held that the Town of Greece violated the Establishment Clause by allowing volunteer private citizens to open town board meetings with a prayer. Though the Town had never regulated the content of the prayers, had permitted any citizen from any religious tradition to volunteer to be a prayer-giver, and did not discriminate in selecting prayer-givers, the court struck down the Town's prayer practice, applying an ""en dorsement"" test derived from Lemon.

Here is question: When the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approves a drug for multiple uses, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug makers to avoid contested patent litigation by marketing generic versions of the drug solely for non-patented uses. The FDA lacks the authority and expertise needed to verify the patent information submitted by name-brand drug companies, however, so it defers to their descriptions of the scope of their patents. Such companies can therefore block the approval of generic drugs by submitting overbroad patent descriptions to the FDA, effectively extending their patents to cover non-infringing uses. To combat this problem, the Act allows a ""counterclaim seeking an order requiring the [patent] holder to correct or delete the patent information submitted by the holder * * * on the ground that the patent does not claim * * * an approved method of using the drug."" 21 U.S.C. § 355(j)(5)(C)(ii)(I). In a 2-1 decision that conflicts with this Court's precedents and recent D.C. Circuit authority, the Federal Circuit held that the counterclaim provision effectively authorizes only ""delet[ingl"" improperly listed patents, but not ""correct[ing]"" information that misrepresents the scope of the approved uses claimed by a patent. That ruling expressly invalidates longstanding FDA regulations defining ""patent information,"" which the FDA deems ""essential"" to administering the Act, without seeking the agency's views. The question presented is:
Whether this counterclaim provision applies where (1) there is ""an approved method of using the drug"" that ""the patent does not claim,"" and (2) the brand submits ""patent information"" to the FDA that misstates the patent's scope, requiring ""correct[ion].""

Whether petitioner's judgment of conviction became ""final"" within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. 2255, para. 6(1) when the court of appeals issued its mandate on direct appeal or when his time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari expired.
Options:
A. holding that for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court on direct review, their judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the conviction
B. holding that the time limit for filing a petition for certiorari is not jurisdictional
C. holding that paroled prisoner is in custody when the terms of his release impose ""significant restraints on petitioner's liberty because of his conviction and sentence, which are in addition to those imposed by the State upon the public generally""
D. holding on petition for writ of certiorari from direct appeal of state criminal proceeding that the language of the anti-shuttling provision of Article IV(e) of the IAD is absolute and even a de minimis violation requires dismissal of the charges
E. holding that where a state prisoner ""does not seek review in a State's highest court, the judgment becomes 'final' under §2244(d) when the time for seeking such review expires,"" and rejecting argument that such cases should ""incorporate the 90-day period for seeking certiorari in determining when [a petitioner's] judgment became final""

Here is question: In enacting the Truth in Lending Act, Congress delegated expansive authority to the Federal Reserve Board to issue implementing regulations. The Act provides that ""these regulations may contain such classifications...as in the judgment of the Board are necessary"" to effectuate the purposes of the statute. 15 U.S.C. § 1604(a). The Federal Reserve exercised this authority by promulgating Regulation Z, a provision of which has since 1981 excluded from the definition of ""finance charge"" any fees imposed ""for exceeding a credit limit."" 12 C.F.R. §226.4(c)(2). In Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, 444 U.S. 555, 565 (1980), this Court held that the Federal Reserve's interpretations of the Truth in Lending Act are dispositive unless interpretations of the Truth in Lending Act are demonstrably irrational. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nevertheless invalidated the Federal Reserve's classification of over-limit fees, holding that Regulation Z's exclusion of such fees from the finance charge conflicts with the Act's general definition of ""finance charge."" The question presented for review is:
Whether the Sixth Circuit improperly substituted its interpretation of the Truth in Lending Act for that of the Federal Reserve - the agency authorized by Congress to interpret the statute - in invalidating an important provision of Regulation Z that affects tens of millions of consumer credit card agreements.
Options:
A. holding that neither an agency's delay in promulgating a regulation nor the fact that ""it was litigation which disclosed the need for the regulation"" affects the court's deference to the agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute as embodied in such regulations
B. holding that the Anti-Injunction Act prohibits federal courts from enjoining state court proceedings unless expressly authorized by an Act of Congress, where necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate its judgments
C. holding that Regulation Z was binding in interpreting an arbitrary provision of TILA

Here is question: Following the Court's decision in M / S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1 (1972), the majority of federal circuit courts hold that a valid forum selection clause renders venue ""improper"" in a forum other than the one designated by contract. In those circuits, forum-selection clauses are routinely enforced through motions to dismiss or transfer venue under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1406. The Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, however, follow a contrary rule. This Petition presents the following issues for review:
Did the Court's decision in Stewart Organization, Inc. v. Ricoh Corp., 487 U.S. 22 (1988), change the standard for enforcement of clauses that designate an alternative federal forum, limiting review of such clauses to a discretionary, balancing-of-conveniences analysis under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)?
Options:
A. holding that a forum selection clause is presumptively valid and should be enforced unless the resisting party demonstrates that enforcement would be unreasonable under the circumstances
B. holding that federal law governs a district court's determination of proper venue and whether to transfer a case based on a contractual forum-selection clause
C. holding that forum-selection clauses, although not ""historically ... favored,"" are ""prima facie valid,"" and declaring that ""the serious inconvenience of the contractual forum to one or both of the parties might carry greater weight in determining the reasonableness of the forum clause""
D. holding that the correct procedural mechanism for enforcement of an FSC specifying a foreign forum is through a motion to dismiss for FNC

Here is question: A defendant seeking removal of a case to federal court must file a notice of removal containing ""a short and plain statement of the grounds for removal"" and attach only the state court filings served on such defendant. 28 U.S.C. § 1446(a). Consistent with that statutory pleading requirement, the First, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits require only that a notice of removal contain allegations of the jurisdictional facts supporting removal; those courts do not require the defendant to attach evidence supporting federal jurisdiction to the notice of removal. District courts in those Circuits may consider evidence supporting removal even if it comes later in response to a motion to remand.
Whether a defendant seeking removal to federal court is required to include evidence supporting federal jurisdiction in the notice of removal, or is alleging the required ""short and plain statement of the grounds for removal"" enough?
Options:
A. holding that a statute permitting removal if the defendant is “[a]ny officer of the United States or [of] any agency thereof” “permits removal by anyone who is an ‘officer’ either ‘of the United States’ or of one of its agencies” (alterations in original) (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1

Here is question: The Comprehensive, Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. §9601 et seq., allows the government to obtain reimbursement for the costs of remediating hazardous waste sites from the owners and operators of land on which a disposal of hazardous substances has occurred. Because even passive landowners may be subjected to CERCLA liability, Congress removed language from early CERCLA bills mandating joint and several liability for multiple defendants who own or operate a particular site. In the present case, the Ninth Circuit nevertheless imposed joint and several liability for the entire cost of a facility’s remediation on two landlords, even though they owned only a portion of the overall site for a fraction of its period of operation, and the parcel they owned required no remediation. The question presented is:
Whether the Ninth Circuit erred by reversing the district court’s reasonable apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA, and by adopting a standard of review and proof requirements that depart from common law principles and conflict with decisions of other circuits.
Options:
A. holding that “the award of monetary damages ... to fund a future clean-up of ... property violate CERCLA” because § 113(g) provides that under § 107 the remedy for future response costs is a declaratory judgment

C. holding CERCLA section 107 provides potentially responsible parties with cause of action to recover necessary costs of response from other PRPs

Here is question: The Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches when “adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated.” Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 688 (1972). This Court has held that when a defendant is arrested, “arraigned on [an arrest] warrant before a judge,” and “committed by the court to confinement,” “[t]here can be no doubt . . . that judicial proceedings ha[ve] been initiated.” Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 399 (1977). In this case, petitioner was arrested and brought before a magistrate judge who informed petitioner of the accusation against him, found probable cause that he had committed the offense based on a police officer’s sworn affidavit, and committed him to jail pending trial or the posting of bail.
The question presented is whether the Fifth Circuit correctly held—in a decision that conflicts with those of other federal courts of appeals and state courts of last resort—that adversary judicial proceedings nevertheless had not commenced, and petitioner’s Sixth Amendment rights had not attached, because no prosecutor was involved in petitioner’s arrest or appearance before the magistrate.
Options:
A. holding that defense counsel may decide whether to consent to voir dire proceedings before a federal magistrate judge
B. holding that, under 28 U.S.C. § 636(c), a consensual referral gives a magistrate judge full authority over dispositive motions, conduct of trial, and entry of final judgment, all without district court review, and that consent to proceedings before a magistrate judge can be inferred from a party's conduct during litigation
C. holding that probable cause exists when “the facts and circumstances within [the officers’] knowledge . . . [are] sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.”

Here is question: California Civil Code sections 1746-1746.5 prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors under 18 where a reasonable person would find that the violent content appeals to a deviant or morbid interest of minors, is patently offensive to prevailing community standards as to what is suitable for minors, and causes the game as a whole to lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.

Does the First Amendment bar a state from restricting the sale of violent video games to minors?
Options:
A. holding that a statutory provision prohibiting any visual depiction that ""is, or appears to be, of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct"" violated the First Amendment insofar as it prohibited virtual imagery of minors that was neither obscene nor involved actual children
B. holding that because ""video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium . . . . [t][hat suffices to confer First Amendment protection.""

B. holding that a participant in a disability plan could not bring suit under § 502 to recover consequential damages arising from delay in the processing of her claim because § 502 ""provid[es] remedies that would protect the entire plan rather than individuals""
C. holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages
D. holding that a contractual right to reimbursement from funds recovered from a third party supported a plan’s action under § 502(a)(3) because the clause established an equitable lien by agreement

Id. at 487. This is Heck's so- called ""favorable termination requirement."" The Sixth Circuit concluded below that Heck's favorable termination requirement does not cover claims challenging parole procedures because success on those claims would not necessarily guarantee speedier release, but instead would provide only a new parole hearing. This raises the following questions:
When a prisoner invokes § 1983 to challenge parole proceedings, does Heck v. Humphrey's favorable termination requirement apply where success by the prisoner on the claim would result only in a new parole hearing and not necessarily guarantee earlier release from prison?

Here is question: The First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the First Circuit which affirmed the decision of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Massachusetts denying the request of the Petitioner, Robert Louis Marrama, to convert his bankruptcy case from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. The bankruptcy court held, in essence, that notwithstanding the plain language of the statute and of the legislative history, the right to convert a case from one chapter to another, found in 11 USC §706(a), can be denied in the bankruptcy court's discretion if the bankruptcy court determines that the request was made in bad faith. In a decision that focused on factual determinations, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel affirmed. The First Circuit Court of Appeals focused on statutory construction and determined that although the legislative history says that the right to convert is ""absolute"", the right can be denied in circumstances such as those presented in this case.

In Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), this Court held that “use” of a firearm under § 924(c) means “active employment.” Id. at 144. The question presented in this case is:
Whether mere receipt of an unloaded firearm as payment for drugs constitutes “use” of the firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(l)(A) and this Court’s decision in Bailey.
Options:
A. holding that person who trades drugs for a gun does not “use” a firearm “during and in relation to . . . drug trafficking crime” within the meaning of Section 924(c)
B. holding that the residual clause in the definition of crime of violence in using, carrying, or possessing a firearm, found in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(B), is unconstitutionally vague
C. holding that under statute prohibiting the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, fact that firearm was a machine gun was an element of the offense to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than a sentencing factor

Here is question: The Fourth Circuit reversed a jury determination in favor of Albert Snyder (""Snyder"") for the intentional harm perpetrated against him by Fred W. Phelps, Sr., Westboro Baptist Church, Incorporated, Rebekah A. Phelps-Davis and Shirley L. Phelps-Roper (collectively, ""Phelps""). Snyder's claim arose out of Phelps' intentional acts at Snyder's son's funeral. Specifically the claims were: (1) intentional infliction of emotional distress, (2) invasion of privacy and (3) civil conspiracy. These claims were dismissed by the Fourth Circuit notwithstanding that (a) Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell does not apply to private versus private individuals; (b) Snyder was a ""captive"" audience; (c) Phelps specifically targeted Snyder and his family; (d) Snyder proved that he was intentionally harmed by clear and convincing evidence;¹ and (e) Phelps disrupted Snyder's mourning process. The Fourth Circuit's decision gives no credence to Snyder's personal stake in honoring and mourning his son and ignores Snyder's right to bury his son with dignity and respect.
Does Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell apply to a private person versus another private person concerning a private matter?

The first question presented is:
Whether traditional equal protection “rational basis” analysis under Village of Willowbrook v Olech, 528 US 562, 120 S Ct 1073, 145 L Ed 2d 1060 (2000) applies to public employers who intentionally treat similarly situated employees differently with no rational bases for arbitrary, vindictive or malicious reasons?
Options:
A. holding that the rational basis standard of review is not ""toothless""
B. holding that ""a classification neither involving fundamental rights nor proceedings along suspect lines . . . cannot run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause if there is a rational relationship between disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose""
C. holding that in equal protection cases not involving a suspect classification or fundamental right, courts apply a rational basis test
D. holding that “the class-of-one theory of equal protection—which presupposes that like individuals should be treated alike, and that to treat them differently is to classify them in a way that must survive at least rationality review—is simply a poor fit in the public context”

C. holding that physicians could be compelled to arbitrate Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951-1960 (""RICO"") claims, because although the arbitration agreement barred awards of punitive damages, it was not clear whether the parties intended the word ""punitive"" to include claims for treble damages under RICO

Here is question: This Court has long held that section 30 of the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. §§ 85-86, creates an exclusive federal cause of action and an exclusive federal remedy for usury claims by borrowers against national banks, preempting state law under the doctrine of ordinary preemption. Borrowers filed this case against a national bank in state court, claiming violation of state usury law, and the national bank removed the case to federal district court, where a motion to remand was denied. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ordered the district court to remand the case to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and explicitly disagreed with decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit holding that section 30 completely preempts state usury claims against national banks and thus permits removal of cases asserting state usury laws against them.
Whether a usury claim against a national bank, even if ostensibly brought under state law, necessarily arises under section 30 of the National Bank Act so as to permit a federal court to exercise removal jurisdiction under the doctrine of complete preemption, a question as to which the United States Courts of Appeals are in conflict?
Options:
A. holding that a national bank “located” in Nebraska, as evidenced by its organization certificate, is entitled by Section 85 of the National Bank Act to charge its Minnesota customers the rate of interest authorized by Nebraska law even though it was higher than that allowed by Minnesota law
B. holding that, absent evidence that Congress intended a federal statute to provide the exclusive remedy for a plaintiff's claims, the question of preemption by federal law is solely a defense, and does not justify removal
C. holding that, because federal preemption under the National Labor Relations Act ousts the state courts of jurisdiction, they could not apply ordinary state pleading rules to refuse to decide a defense of preemption based on federal labor laws
D. holding that a district court may decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims by considering a ""host"" of factors, ""including the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state law claims, and the character of the governing state law, and the relationship between the state and federal claims""

Here is question: In Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U .S. 678 (2001), this Court avoided constitutional concerns by interpreting 8 U.S.C. 1231(a)(6) to limit to a ""reasonable time"" the period that permanent resident aliens may be detained following final orders directing their removal from the United States. Applying that standard, the Court held that a resident alien generally may not be detained under Section 1231(a)(6) for more than six months after being ordered removed, if the alien demonstrates that there is not a significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.
The question presented in this case is whether Section 1231(a)(6) and Zadvydas compel the release of an arriving alien who was apprehended at the border of the United States, denied admission, and ordered removed from the United States.
Options:
A. holding that lawful permanent resident aliens may only be held pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1231 for a period reasonably necessary to secure the alien's removal and establishing a presumption that detention is reasonable for six months after the conclusion of the removal period
B. holding that the Fourth Amendment protects only ""the people"" of the United States and has no application to search-and-seizure challenges where the challenger is a non-citizen/non-resident alien with no voluntary attachment to the United States and the area searched is located outside of the United States
C. holding that Zadvydas applied to all categories of aliens who were detained including ""those ordered removed who are inadmissible,"" because the phrase ""may be detained beyond the removal period"" has to be interpreted to apply to all categories of aliens under § 1231
D. holding that an ""innocent, casual and brief"" excursion [4] by a resident alien outside the country's borders for four hours may not be considered a departure disruptive of his resident alien status

Options:
A. holding that the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause because it does not “differentiate among bona fide faiths” and “confers no privileged status on any particular religious sect, and singles out no bona fide faith for disadvantageous treatment”

A. holding that an Internal Revenue Service investigation to determine a taxpayer's civil tax liability is not ""preliminar[y] to or in connection with a judicial proceeding"" within the meaning of Rule 6(e)(C), and therefore no disclosure is available under that Rule

Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 318 (1985), abrogated when the initial failure to give the Miranda warnings was intentional?

In the instant matter, Petitioner's only conviction occurred in Okinawa, Japan, and it was this Japanese conviction that served as the predicate felony in this §922(g)(I) prosecution. The Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the indictment arguing that foreign felonies were not intended to count as the term ""in any court"" means any court in the United States.

California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931), required the reversal of the judgment if a general verdict could have rested on an instruction that defined a constitutionally defective alternative theory of criminal liability. However, a modern line of cases, including Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1 (1999), establishes that error in instructing on an element of a charged crime is not “structural error,” so as to require automatic reversal, but is instead “trial error” and, as such, may be harmless. The question presented is:
Did the Ninth Circuit fail to conform to “clearly established” Supreme Court law, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), when it granted habeas corpus relief by deeming an erroneous instruction on one of two alternative theories of guilt to be “structural error” requiring reversal because the jury might have relied on it?

Here is question: The principal federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. 1956(a)(1), makes it a crime to engage in a financial transaction using the “proceeds” of certain specified unlawful activities with the intent to promote those activities or to conceal the proceeds.
The question presented is whether “proceeds” means the gross receipts from the unlawful activities or only the profits, i.e., gross receipts less expenses.

Here is question: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a), has been interpreted to provide an implied private right of action for sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions. Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code creates an express remedy for violations of the U.S. Constitution. Three courts of appeals have held that Title IX’s implied remedy does not foreclose Section 1983 claims to enforce the Constitution’s prohibition against invidious sex discrimination. In contrast, four circuits, including the First Circuit in this case, have held that Title IX’s implied right of action is the exclusive remedy for sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions. The question presented is:
Whether Title IX’s implied right of action precludes Section 1983 constitutional claims to remedy sex discrimination by federally funded educational institutions.
Options:
A. holding that Title IX, 20 U.S.C. § 1681, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, thereby prohibits retaliation because “[r]etaliation ... is a form of ‘discrimination’ ” and is “ ‘discrimination on the basis of sex’ because it is an intentional response to ... an allegation of sex discrimination”
B. holding that an implied private cause of action exists under Title IX, which states that ""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied to the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance""
C. holding employees may bring a discrimination claim under Title IX when they ""directly participate in federal programs,"" ""directly benefit from federal grants, loans, or contracts,"" or are ""subject to discrimination under"" the funded education program
D. holding that litigation under the more restrictive statute of Title IX did not preclude litigation under Section 1983
E. holding that Title IX's implied private right of action will not lie in absence of school district's ""deliberate indifference"" to teacher's conduct upon actual receipt of notice thereof

Here is question: In a civil case against police officers for excessive force, a court must grant qualified immunity unless the use of force was prohibited by clearly established law. Here, the Sixth Circuit denied qualified immunity for force used in 2004 to end a vehicular pursuit that is similar to the force ruled permissible in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007). The Sixth Circuit denied qualified immunity by distinguishing Scott ""in the details"" from the force used three years earlier in this case. (Pet. App. at 8-9.) The Sixth Circuit applied a similar analysis in Walker v. Davis, 649 F.3d 502 (6th Cir. 2011), where it also distinguished Scott to deny qualified immunity for pre-2007 conduct. As Judge McKeague noted in his extended dissent, the Sixth Circuit stands alone in this analysis. Id. at 504- 11 (McKeague, J., dissenting). Petitioners believe this Court has an opportunity to correct the errors in the Sixth Circuit's qualified immunity analysis by agreeing to hear their case. The specific questions presented are as follows:
Whether the Sixth Circuit wrongly denied qualified immunity to Petitioners by analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007). Stated otherwise, the question presented is whether, for qualified immunity purposes, the Sixth Circuit erred in analyzing whether the force was supported by subsequent case decisions as opposed to prohibited by clearly established law at the time the force was used.
Options:
A. holding that the court evaluating a claim of qualified immunity must first determine whether the plaintiff states a claim of a constitutional violation at all, and then must determine whether the claimed right was clearly established, before proceeding to the qualified immunity question
B. holding that the Sixth Circuit erred in finding that the state court's jury instructions were contrary to clearly established federal law
C. holding that public officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless the plaintiff demonstrates that there is “a violation of a constitutional right” and that right is “clearly established . . . in light of the specific context of the case” (internal quotation marks omitted)
D. holding that ""if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended"" and concluding that it was not unreasonable for officers to fire fifteen shots in a ten-second span

McKnight, 521 U.S. 399, 408 (1997), a bare majority of this Court declined to extend qualified immunity to private prison guards, but expressly noted a historical basis of immunity for private lawyers working ""at the behest of the sovereign."" Id. at 407. The Richardson majority also expressly did not preclude qualified immunity for private parties working as ""adjunct[s] to government."" Id. at 413. Based on Richardson, the Sixth Circuit has accorded immunity to such ""private"" lawyers. Cullinan v. Abramson, 128 F.3d 301 (6th Cir. 1997). Contravening Richardson and expressly disagreeing with Cullinan, the Ninth Circuit in this case denied qualified immunity to a ""private"" lawyer retained by the government solely because of his ""private"" status, even though it accorded qualified immunity to all of the individual government actors involved, thereby completely exonerating them for the very same conduct, which did not violate any clearly established rights.

Here is question: The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's jurisdiction over the Republic of Austria, a sovereign state, and its national museum, the Austrian Gallery, for a disputed expropriation claim that arose in 1948, twenty-eight years before enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq. (""FSIA""). The claim challenges the Republic's ownership of artwork that is and always has been located in Austria. Jurisdiction and venue in the Central District of California were asserted notwithstanding that (a) the claims in this case arose before the United States adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in 1952, at a time when Austria had an expectation of absolute immunity from private civil suit in United States courts; (b) the United States opposes a finding of jurisdiction in this case; (c) respondent did not exhaust her legal remedies in Austria; (d) no part of the alleged events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in any judicial district in the United States, or concern any commercial activity here. In holding that the FSIA may be retrospectively applied to pre-1952 events, the Ninth Circuit's decision directly conflicts with the holdings of the Second, Eleventh and District of Columbia Circuits.
Does the expropriation exception of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (""FSIA""), 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(3), afford jurisdiction over claims against foreign states based on conduct that occurred before the United States adopted the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity in 1952?

Here is question: In December 2001, in an earlier appeal in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that an attorney's fee application under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d), is jurisdictionally barred if the fee applicant does not allege, within the statute's 30-day limitations period, that the position of the United States lacked substantial justification, even when the application itself is timely filed and the applicant promptly amends the application to supply the allegation. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that its holding directly conflicted with decisions of other circuits. On June 17, 2002, this Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the Federal Circuit's decision, and remanded in light of Edelman v. Lynchburg College, 122 S. Ct. 1145 (2002). In a nearly verbatim reprise of its earlier ruling, the Federal Circuit again held the fee application jurisdictionally barred. That court again acknowledged the circuit split and then found Edelman inapposite. The question presented is the same as that presented in the earlier petition to this Court:
Whether, or in what circumstances, an applicant for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act is barred from obtaining a fee award by the Act's 30-day statute of limitations solely because the applicant's timely-filed fee application did not initially allege that the position of the government in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification.
Options:
A. holding that ""when the underlying cause of action is based on federal law and the absence of an express federal statute of limitations makes it necessary to borrow a limitations period from another statute, the action is not barred if it has been commenced in compliance with Rule 3 within the borrowed period.""
B. holding that statutory time limit for filing attorney-fee reimbursement applications under Equal Access to Justice Act was not jurisdictional because time limit did not “describe what ‘classes of cases,’ the [court] is competent to adjudicate; instead, the section relate[d] only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within court's adjudicatory authority”
C. holding that the Court of Federal Claims is not the appropriate authority to determine retirement issues, as that arena of federal employee litigation is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
D. holding that the court was “unable to affirm the [fee award] ... because the District Court's opinion did not properly consider the relationship between the extent of success and the amount of the fee award” or “answer the question of what is ‘reasonable’ in light of that level of success”
E. holding that an award of fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d), is payable to the litigant, not to the attorney, and thus is available to offset a debt to the government

Thus, a service provider who provides assistance to a company that makes a public misstatement cannot be held liable in a private securities-fraud action. Stoneridge Inv. Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., 128 S. Ct. 761 (2008). In the decision below, however, the Fourth Circuit held that an investment adviser who allegedly 'helped draft the misleading prospectuses' of a different company, 'by participating in the writing and dissemination of [those] prospectuses,' can be held liable in a private action 'even if the statement on its face is not directly attributed to the [adviser].' App., infra, 17a-18a, 24a (emphases added). The questions presented are:

The question presented is whether the term ""cocaine base"" encompasses every form of cocaine that is classified chemically as a base - which would mean that the ten-year mandatory minimum applies to an offense involving 50 grams or more of raw coca leaves or of the paste derived from coca leaves, but that 5000 grams of cocaine powder would be required to trigger the same ten-year minimum - or whether the term ""cocaine base"" is limited to ""crack"" cocaine.

Here is question: Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that any degree of judicial participation in plea negotiations, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1), automatically requires vacatur of a defendant's guilty plea, irrespective of whether the error prejudiced the defendant.
Options:
A. holding that a guilty plea was not involuntary “because [it was] entered to D-7 avoid the possibility of a death penalty” as the defendant had a “full opportunity to assess the advantages and disadvantages of a trial as compared with those attending a plea of guilty”
B. holding that a guilty plea accompanied by protestations of innocence is valid when the ""defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt""
C. holding that Rule 11(c) error is not a form of ""structural"" error and, therefore, that ""Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule)""
D. holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”

Here is question: Under the ""state action doctrine,"" the federal antitrust laws do not apply to the anticompetitive conduct of certain subordinate public entities created by a State if the conduct is authorized as part of a ""state policy to displace competition"" that is ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed"" in state law. Town of Hallie v. City of Eau Claire, 471 U.S. 34,38-39 (1985) (citations omitted). The doctrine extends to private entities if the state policy is so articulated and the private conduct is ""'actively supervised' by the State itself,"" California Retail Liquor Dealers Ass'n v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980) (citation omitted). ""[T]he State may not,"" however, ""validate * * * anticompetitive conduct simply by declaring it to be lawful."" Hallie, 471 U.S. at 39. In this case, a local government entity created by Georgia law, acting at the behest of a private actor and using the general corporate powers conferred on it by the State, acquired the only competitor of that private actor arid immediately transferred control of the competitor to the private actor, creating a private monopoly. The questions presented are as follows:
Whether the Georgia legislature, by vesting the local government entity with general corporate powers to acquire and lease out hospitals and other property, has ""clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed"" a ""state policy to displace competition"" in the market for hospital services.
Options:
A. holding that municipal and certain “substate” entities of government receive immunity from antitrust scrutiny when they act pursuant to clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy to displace competition, without regard to whether their activities are actively supervised by the state
B. holding that ""[a]ction taken by private entities with the mere approval or acquiescence of the State is not state action""
C. holding that a state actor's voluntary decision to adopt a private association's rules did not transform the private association's rules into state rules nor did it transform the private actor into a state actor
D. holding that ""[i]t is not necessary . . . for the state legislature to have stated explicitly that it expected the [defendants] to engage in conduct that would have anticompetitive effects,"" it is sufficient that the anticompetitive conduct is a foreseeable result of the authorization
E. holding that district court has power to ""assum[e] direct supervision"" of state property ""if state recalcitrance or state-law barriers should be continued,"" and that the court may ""displace local enforcement of [the court's] orders if necessary to remedy the violations of federal law found by the court""

Here is question: (1) Did the California Supreme Court violate the rule of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) and the equal protection clause when it declared that the threshold  for  a  prima  facie  case  of  racial  discrimination  in  jury  selection  is proof that it is  ""more likely than not"" that discrimination occurred, which test presents  a  much    higher  and  more  difficult  threshold  to  reach  than  the standard  established  by  this    Court  in  Batson,  namely,  that  a  prima  facie case is shown when there is an ""inference"" of discrimination?
(2) In a criminal case where the prosecutor peremptorily challenged all three black prospective jurors, leaving Petitioner, a black man, to be tried by a jury with no  black jurors, did the California Supreme Court violate Batson when it held  that  the    challenges  to  all  three  black  jurors,  did  not  present  even  an inference  of  racial    discrimination,  which  is  necessary  to  establish  a  prima facie case?
(3) Did the California Supreme Court violate the Constitution when it refused to  apply  comparative  juror  analysis  --  namely,  comparing  answers  given  on voir  dire  by  minority  jurors  who  were  challenged  with  the  answers  given  to the  same  questions    by  white  jurors  who  were  accepted  --  in  determining whether  the  claimed  reasons  for  challenging  the  minority  jurors  were pretextual?
(4)  Is  not  this  Court's  recent  opinion  in  Miller-El  v.  Cockrell,  537  U.S.  322, 154  L.Ed.2d  931,  123  S.Ct.  1029  (2003),  which  expressly  approves comparative  juror    analysis,  retroactively  applicable  to  a  case  on  direct appeal,  pursuant  to  Griffith  v.  Kentucky,  479  U.S.  314,  93  L.Ed.2d  649 (1987), or, instead, is the state court free  to ignore Miller-El, and to refuse to  apply  comparative  juror  analysis,  and  to  refuse    to  determine  if  claimed reasons for challenges to minority jurors are pretextual?
Whether to establish a prima facie case under Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), the objector must show that it is more likely than not the other party's peremptory challenges, if unexplained, were based on impermissible group bias?
Options:
A. holding that race based peremptory strikes for jurors violate the equal protection rights of the challenged jurors and that the court, by allowing this to occur, had ""involved itself with invidious discrimination.""
B. holding that in a case alleging intentional employment discrimination by means of termination of employment, a prima facie case is established ""when a member of a protected group is discharged under circumstances which, if unexplained, would support an inference that the decision to discharge was `based on the consideration of impermissible factors.'""

D. holding proper standard for judging whether prima facie case had arisen was Batson ""inference of discriminatory purpose"" standard, not California's Wheeler ""strong likelihood"" test for successful prima facie showing of bias

In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress defined the phrase ""[t]o perform ... 'publicly'"" to include, among other things, ""to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work ... to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times."" Id. §101. Congress enacted that provision with the express intent to bring within the scope of the public-performance right services that retransmit over-the-air television broadcasts to the public. Respondent Aereo offers just such a service. Aereo captures over-the-air television broadcasts and, without obtaining authorization from or compensating anyone, retransmits that programming to tens of thousands of members of the public over the Internet for a profit. According to the Second Circuit, because Aereo sends each of its subscribers an individualized transmission of a performance from a unique copy of each copyrighted program, it is not transmitting performances ""to the public,"" but rather is engaged in tens of thousands of ""private"" performances to paying strangers.

Options:
A. holding that a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him is violated when the confession of a non-testifying co-defendant, in which the defendant is expressly implicated as a participant in the crime, is admitted in the joint trial of the two defendants
B. holding that to determine whether the judge-found fact increased the defendant’s sen- tence above the statutory maximum, courts must look at “the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defen- dant”

Here is question: The primary purpose of The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the ""Hague Convention"" or the ""Convention"") is to protect children from international abduction by returning an abducted child to the nation of habitual residence for adjudication of custody rights under that nation's laws. To further that purpose, Article 12 of the Convention mandates that an abducted child must be returned if the left-behind parent's petition for the child's return is filed within one year of the abduction. In doing so, the Convention deters international child abductions by removing the benefit an abducting parent would otherwise obtain or perceive under the laws of the nation to which he or she has abducted the child. If the left-behind parent is unable, or otherwise fails, to determine the situs of the child and meet this one-year filing deadline, the court must still order the return of the child unless the abducting parent demonstrates one of four affirmative defenses, including that the child is ""settled"" in her new environment. The circuit courts of appeal are split over whether equitable tolling may apply to the one-year period. While the Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits all hold the one-year period may be equitably tolled, the Second Circuit held in this case that the one-year period is not subject to equitable tolling and the settled defense is still available even where, as here, the abducting parent conceals the location of the child.
Whether a district court considering a petition under the Hague Convention for the return of an abducted child may equitably toll the running of the one-year filing period when the abducting parent has concealed the whereabouts of the child from the left-behind parent.
Options:
A. holding that a noncustodial parent did not have standing to assert the constitutional claims of his daughter when the parent with exclusive legal custody objected on the grounds that litigation was not in the child’s best interest

C. holding unconstitutional a provision of the Social Security Act which allowed an illegitimate child to obtain benefits if a disabled parent either contributed to the child's support or lived with the child prior to the disability

Here is question: In Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21 (1974), and Menna v. New York, 423 U.S. 61 (1975), this Court held that a defendant who pleads guilty can still raise on appeal any constitutional claim that does not depend on challenging his ""factual guilt."" In Blackledge and Menna, the Court held that double jeopardy and vindictive prosecution are two such claims that are not inherently resolved by pleading guilty, because those claims do not challenge whether the government could properly meet its burden of proving each element of the crime.

In the years since this Court decided Blackledge and Menna, the circuit courts have deeply divided on whether a defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of his statute of conviction survives a plea, or instead is inherently waived as part of the concession of factual guilt.

The question presented is:
Whether a guilty plea inherently waives a defendant's right to challenge the constitutionality of his statute of conviction?
Options:
A. holding that a guilty plea accompanied by protestations of innocence is valid when the ""defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt""
B. holding that defendants' ""guilty plea served as a relinquishment of their opportunity to receive a factual hearing on a double jeopardy claim. Relinquishment derives not from any inquiry into a defendant's subjective understanding of the range of potential defenses, but from the admissions necessarily made upon entry of a voluntary plea of guilty.""
C. holding a defendant who pleaded guilty did not waive Second Amendment and due process challenges to statute of conviction because claims did not ""contradict the terms of the indictment or the written plea agreement""
D. holding that attorney does not have the power to enter a plea of guilty or to admit guilt ""in effect"" where the defendant has not consented to such a strategy

Here is question: In Franklin v. Lynaugh, this Court concluded that a capital defendant does not have a constitutional right to an instruction telling the jury in the penalty phase to consider ""residual doubt"" about defendant's guilt. Most state and federal appellate courts have read this decision more broadly than its precise holding and have concluded that a capital defendant has no constitutional right to offer evidence and argue in a penalty- phase proceeding that he should receive a sentence less than death because he continues to assert his innocence of the underlying crime. The Oregon Supreme Court, however, held in this case that a capital defendant has a federal constitutional right to present in a penalty-phase proceeding alibi evidence that casts doubt on his guilt. The question presented is:
Does a capital defendant have a right under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution to offer evidence and argument in support of a residual-doubt claim - that is, that the jury in a penalty-phase proceeding should consider doubt about the defendant's guilt in deciding whether to impose the death penalty?
Options:
A. holding that defendant did not have an Eighth Amendment right to an instruction that the jury could consider ""residual doubts"" about guilt as mitigating circumstances during sentencing
B. holding that a jury instruction that stated that the jury could consider all the mitigating evidence presented during both the guilt and penalty stage was sufficient to inform the jury that it could consider evidence of defendant’s youth
C. holding that state re-sentencing procedure that allowed for introduction of transcripts of guilt phase evidence adequately protected any right capital defendant might have to argue ""residual doubt"" as a mitigating factor
D. holding that once defendant has been convicted fairly in guilt phase of capital trial, presumption of innocence disappears; ""presumption [of innocence] operates at the guilt phase of a trial to remind the jury that the State has the burden of establishing every element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt""
E. holding that counsel's strategic decision, made without the defendant's express consent, to concede, in his opening statement at guilt phase of capital murder trial, the defendant's commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing defendant's life, is not per se prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel

Whether the virtually per se prohibition against “hoard[ing] solid waste” (Id. at 392) recognized in Carbone is inapplicable when the “preferred processing facility” (ibid.) is owned by a public entity.
Options:
A. holding that Alabama statute imposing additional fees on hazardous waste generated outside Alabama and disposed of at Alabama facilities violated the Commerce Clause because it discriminated against interstate commerce on its face
B. holding that two New York counties' ordinances governing the flow of solid waste does not violate the Commerce Clause, in part because “[w]aste disposal is both typically and traditionally a local government function” (alteration in original)
C. holding that a state may not insulate part of its market from out-of-state competition while leaving other parts open, because this ""measures only the extent of the discrimination; it is of no relevance to the determination whether a State has discriminated against interstate commerce""

Here is question: For ten years, Henry W. Skinner has sought access to DNA testing that could prove him innocent of the murders that landed him on Death Row. After the Texas courts arbitrarily turned back his diligent attempts to take advantage of state statutes affording such relief, he sued in federal court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate his due process right to 'fundamental fairness in [the] operation' of Texas's scheme. Dist. Att’y's Office v. Osborne, 129 S. Ct. 2308, 2320 (2009) (citation omitted). The district court dismissed Mr. Skinner's § 1983 suit solely on the ground that his claim sounded only in habeas corpus, and the Fifth Circuit summarily affirmed. The question presented is the same one the Court granted certiorari in Osborne to decide, but left unresolved:
May a convicted prisoner seeking access to biological evidence for DNA testing assert that claim in a civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, or is such a claim cognizable only in a petition for writ of habeas corpus?
Options:

Does a criminal defendant “forfeit” his or her Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause claims upon a mere showing that the defendant has caused the unavailability of a witness, as some courts have held, or must there also be an additional showing that the defendant’s actions were undertaken for the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying, as other courts have held?

Here is question: Many patients seek genetic testing to see if they have mutations in their genes that are associated with a significantly increased risk of breast or ovarian cancer. Respondent Myriad Genetics obtained patents on two human genes that correlate to this risk, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. These patents claim every naturally-occurring version of those genes, including mutations, on the theory that Myriad invented something patent- eligible simply by removing (""isolating"") the genes from the body.

A. holding that ""[i]f the possession of insider information was a critical issue of ultimate fact in all of the charges against petitioner, a jury verdict that necessarily decided that issue in his favor protects him from prosecution for any charge for which that is an essential element""
B. holding that sentences are ""not in fact fully concurrent"" when a defendant ""had at least a pecuniary interest in securing review of his conviction on each of the counts""
C. holding that the trial court’s statement, in response to the jury’s note regarding its inability to reach a verdict, that “You have got to reach a decision in this case[,]” was coercive, and reversing the defendant’s conviction and remanding for a new trial
D. holding that in ""sentencing package cases,"" an appellate court ""may vacate the entire sentence on all counts so that, on remand, the trial court can reconfigure the sentencing plan to ensure that it remains adequate to satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. § 3553""
E. holding that while the government may permissibly pursue a multiple count-indictment for the ""same offense"", even though the legislature did not intend that multiple punishments be imposed for that offense, the district court should enter judgment upon only one of the statutory offenses when the jury returns guilty verdicts on both counts

Here is question: Police officers entered an apartment building in hot pursuit of a person who sold crack cocaine to an undercover informant. They heard a door slam, but were not certain which of two apartments the trafficker fled into. A strong odor of marijuana emanated from one of the doors, which prompted the officers to believe the trafficker had fled into that apartment. The officers knocked on the door. They then heard noises which indicated that physical evidence was being destroyed. The officers entered the apartment and found large quantities of drugs. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that this evidence should have been suppressed, ruling that (1) the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the officers created the exigency by knocking on the door, and (2) the hot pursuit exception to the warrant requirement did not apply because the suspect was not aware he was being pursued. The two questions presented are:
When does lawful police action impermissibly ""create"" exigent circumstances which preclude warrantless entry; and which of the five tests currently being used by the United States Courts of Appeals is proper to determine when impermissibly created exigent circumstances exist?
Options:
A. holding that probable cause must be accompanied by a warrant, exigent circumstances, or some other exception to the warrant requirement to make a search constitutional
B. holding that police cannot personally determine when there is sufficient justification for searching the home of a third party for the subject of an arrest warrant, in the absence of exigent circumstances, any more than they can justify warrantless entry to search for objects

A. holding that Rule 11(c) error is not a form of ""structural"" error and, therefore, that ""Rule 11(h), specifically designed to stop automatic vacaturs, calls for across-the-board application of the harmless-error prescription (or, absent prompt objection, the plain-error rule)""
B. holding that a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, must show “a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea”
C. holding that a defendant who does not object to a Rule 11 error in the district court is subject to the Rule 52(b) plain-error standard on appeal, even though Rule 11 does not have a provision stating that plain error review applies to claims not brought to the district court's attention
D. holding that petitioner may satisfy prejudice prong of two- part Strickland standard following guilty plea if petitioner shows “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial”

Here is question: May a criminal defendant who, despite being legally competent, is schizophrenic, delusional, and mentally decompensatory in the course of a simple conversation, be denied the right to represent himself at trial when the trial court reasonably concludes that permitting self-representation would deny the defendant a fair trial? The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted limited to the following question:
May states adopt a higher standard for measuring competency to represent oneself at trial than for measuring competency to stand trial?
Options:
A. holding that a trial court must conduct, sua sponte, a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant’s competence
B. holding that the acts of a defendant's criminal trial standby counsel did not deprive the defendant of his right of self-representation
C. holding that the defendant -- who suffered from severe schizophrenia, was found incompetent to stand trial multiple times, and was committed to the state hospital while awaiting trial -- was competent to stand trial but not competent to represent himself due to his severe mental illness
D. holding that trial court's failure to give requested instruction on presumption of innocence resulted in violation of defendant's right to a fair trial

Options:

When  a  district  court,  upon  the  plaintiffs  written  consent,  refers  a  case  to  a magistrate  judge  for  trial,  see  28  U.S.C.  §636(c),  and  all  parties,  the  magistrate judge, and the jury proceed in a manner consistent with that referral, must a court of  appeals sua sponte vacate the judgment for lack of jurisdiction because defendants did not expressly consent, or can defendants cure that alleged defect by confirming,  in  a  post-judgment  filing  with  the  district  court,  their  consent  to  trial before the magistrate judge?
Options:
A. holding that § 636(b)(B) allows magistrate judges to enter reports and recommendations on all ""actions for monetary or injunctive relief"" which are ""brought by prisoners . . . under 42 U.S.C. § 1983"" without the parties' consent

Here is question: In Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370 (1990), this Court upheld the constitutionality of California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in capital cases, which directs a jury to consider ""any other circumstance which extenuates the gravity of the crime even though it is not a legal excuse for the crime."" The mitigating evidence at issue in Boyde was pre-crime evidence in mitigation. Relying on Boyde, the California Supreme Court held that California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in this capital case is constitutional as applied to post-crime evidence in mitigation. In a 6-5 decision, the en banc Ninth Circuit held that the California Supreme Court decision was objectively unreasonable ""because Boyde does not control this case."" The question presented is:
Did the Ninth Circuit violate 28 U .S.C. § 2254 (d) when it found the California Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in holding that California's ""catch-all"" mitigation instruction in capital cases is constitutional as applied to post-crime evidence in mitigation?
Options:
A. holding that the failure to present cumulative mitigation evidence at sentencing did not prejudice the defendant
B. holding that the defendant's contacts with California were sufficient to establish minimum contacts because the allegedly libelous publication reported activities in California, most of the harm or ""effects"" to the plaintiffs reputation and career occurred in California, and the defendant's intentional tortious actions were ""aimed at California""
C. holding that a proper prejudice analysis under Strickland must take into account the newly uncovered mitigation evidence, along with the mitigation evidence introduced during the penalty phase of the trial, to assess whether a reasonable probability arises that the petitioner would have received a different sentence after a constitutionally sufficient mitigation investigation.
D. holding that the California Supreme Court's decision that a jury was not reasonably likely to think it could not consider post-conviction mitigation evidence when given a general jury instruction to consider all mitigation evidence, although perhaps ""erroneous,"" was not unreasonable under AEDPA

Options:
A. holding that warrantless search does not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights when search is based upon consent of third party whom officers reasonably believe possesses authority over searched premises

When a United States District Court re-characterizes a pro-se federal prisoner's first post conviction motion as a habeas petition under 28 USC sec. 2255, does such re-characterization render the prisoner's subsequent attempt to file a first titled sec. 2255 petition a ""second or successive petition"" within the purview of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA)?

Here is question: Substantial federal question and original jurisdiction prerequisites for removal to federal district court. 28 U.S.C. §1441(b) allows removal of any state civil action in which the district courts have original jurisdiction wherein the claim is founded on a right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States. This Court has routinely held that such removal requires both a substantial federal question and the district court must have original jurisdiction over the action. The question raised is:
When there is a violation by the IRS of 26 U.S.C. §6335(a) by intentionally ignoring the prerequisite provision requiring personal service of notice of seizure before obtaining service by certified mail, whether the defendant in a state quiet title action can remove the action by claiming that the necessary interpretation of 26 U.S.C. §6335(a) as to whether strict compliance or substantial compliance with the statute constitutes a substantial federal question and creates original jurisdiction in the district court.
Options:
A. holding that unauthorized removal does not pose a jurisdictional problem so long as the district court would have had original jurisdiction over the action had it been filed there initially
B. holding that a state cause of action arises under federal law if, among other things, it requires resolution of a substantial and contested federal issue

Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 225 (2002), this Court held that, where a California prisoner ""unreasonably"" delays in filing a state habeas corpus petition after denial in a lower court, that application is not ""'pending' during this period' and therefore does not toll the one-year statute of limitations for filing federal habeas corpus petitions. The Court further held that the California Supreme Court's denial of a habeas petition on the merits does not itself ""indicate that the petition was timely."" Id. at 226. The question presented is:
Did the Ninth Circuit contravene this Court's decision in Carey v. Saffold when it held that a prisoner who delayed more than three years before filing a habeas petition with the California Supreme Court did not ""unreasonably"" delay in filing the petition -- and therefore was entitled to tolling during that entire period -- because the California Supreme Court summarily denied the petition without comment or citation, which the Ninth Circuit construes as a denial ""on the merits""?

But the Eleventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit now have issued directly conflicting final judgments about the facial constitutionality of the ACA's mandate that virtually every individual American must obtain health insurance. 26 U.S.C. § 5000A. Moreover, despite the fact that the mandate is a ""requirement"" that Congress itself deemed ""essential"" to the Act's new insurance regulations, 42 U.S.C. § 18091(a)(2)(I), the Eleventh Circuit held that the mandate is severable from the remainder of the Act.

Prior to his recapture in Canada years later, the trial court exercised its discretion under state forfeiture law to dismiss respondent's post-verdict motions, resulting in default of most appellate claims. On federal habeas corpus review, the court of appeals refused to honor the state court's procedural bar, ruling that, because ""the state court ... had discretion"" in applying the rule, it was not ""firmly established"" and was therefore ""inadequate.""

Here is question: Whether the Federal Arbitration Act preempts States from conditioning the enforcement of an arbitration agreement on the availability of particular procedures--here, class-wide arbitration--when those procedures are not necessary to ensure that the parties to the arbitration agreement are able to vindicate their claims.
Options:
A. holding that a California law requiring classwide arbitration was preempted by the FAA because it ""stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,"" which is to promote arbitration and enforce arbitration agreements according to their terms
B. holding that class arbitration ""changes the nature of arbitration to such a degree that it cannot be presumed the parties consented to it by simply agreeing to submit their disputes to an arbitrator""
C. holding that when the parties in court proceedings include claims that are subject to an arbitration agreement, the FAA requires that agreement to be enforced even if a state statute or common-law rule would otherwise exclude that claim from arbitration
D. holding that the Arbitration Act ""leaves no place for the exercise of discretion by a district court, but instead mandates that district courts shall direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as to which an arbitration agreement has been signed""

Here is question: Section 48 of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibits the knowing creation, sale, or possession of a depiction of a live animal being intentionally maimed, mutilated, tortured, wounded, or killed, with the intention of placing that depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain, where the conduct depicted is illegal under Federal law or the law of the State in which the creation, sale, or possession takes place, and the depiction lacks serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value.
The question presented is whether 18 U.S.C. 48 is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
Options:
A. holding that under 18 U.S.C. § 1202, a statute criminalizing possession ""in interstate commerce or affecting commerce"" of a firearm by a convicted felon, proof that the possessed firearm previously traveled in interstate commerce was sufficient to satisfy the required nexus between possession and commerce
B. holding that a federal law criminalizing the possession of animal cruelty videos and photographs was facially overbroad because the statute ""applies to common depictions of ordinary and lawful activities, and that these depictions constitute the vast majority of materials subject to the statute""

Here is question: At the end of ten years of capital federal habeas corpus proceedings in the district court, respondent suddenly complained about and sought replacement of his court-appointed public defender with a new appointed lawyer. The district court refused, explaining that ""it appears Petitioner's counsel is doing a proper job"" and that ""[n]o conflict of interest or inadequacy of counsel is shown,"" and thereupon issued its ruling denying habeas corpus relief. On appeal, however, the Ninth Circuit appointed a replacement lawyer, vacated the judgment, and remanded for further proceedings to allow the new lawyer to raise additional claims for relief. The Ninth Circuit explained that no showing of ineffectiveness of counsel was required, for it was enough that Clair had expressed ""dissatisfaction"" and had alleged that the public defender was failing to pursue potentially important evidence.
Whether a condemned state prisoner in federal habeas corpus proceedings is entitled to replace his court-appointed counsel with another court appointed lawyer just because he expresses dissatisfaction and alleges that his counsel was failing to pursue potentially important evidence.
Options:
A. holding that petitioner did not have a ""constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment"" and that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during state habeas appellate proceedings does not constitute cause to excuse the procedural defects
B. holding that ""courts should employ the same 'interests of justice' standard that they apply in non-capital cases under a related statute, [18 U.S.C. ] § 3006A,"" to capital cases as well

Here is question: This Petition involves a public employee retirement plan that includes normal and disability retirement benefits. A member who is eligible for normal retirement benefits based on attained age plus a minimum service requirement, or based on service alone, is not eligible for disability retirement benefits. Because age may be a factor in determining eligibility for normal retirement, it is an indirect factor in determining eligibility for disability retirement. Moreover, the calculation of disability retirement benefits is based upon actual years of service plus the number of years remaining before the member reaches retirement age or eligibility based on years of service alone; age may thereby be an indirect factor in determining the amount of disability retirement benefits. The question presented in this Petition is accordingly:
Whether any use of age as a factor in a retirement plan is “arbitrary” and thus renders the plan facially discriminatory in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act?
Options:
A. holding that the correlation of age with pension status did not, by itself, support an inference of age discrimination and to state an ADEA disparate-treatment claim a plaintiff must show that the differential treatment was ""actually motivated"" by age, not pension status
B. holding that a district court may not use inherent power to remand in a disability benefits case

Section 340B requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to enter into contracts setting forth the Act's pricing restrictions, and drug manufacturers are required to enter into those contracts as a condition of participation in Medicaid. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396b(1)(10), 1396r-8(a)(1) & (b)(l)(A). In the decision below, the Ninth Circuit held that the more than 2,700 covered 340B entities within the territory covered by the circuit have a private right of action under 'federal common law' to enforce the Act's pricing requirements, even though the Act itself contains no express or implied private right of action. In direct conflict with the decisions of the Second, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits, the Ninth Circuit held that, notwithstanding the absence of a private right of action under the Act, a plaintiff may circumvent congressional intent under a federal common law claim that the plaintiff is a third-party beneficiary of a contract that embodies statutory requirements.
The question presented is whether, in the absence of a private right of action to enforce a statute, federal courts have the federal common law authority to confer a private right of action simply because the statutory requirement sought to be enforced is embodied in a contract.
Options:
A. holding there is no implied private right of action, pursuant to Bivens, for damages against private entities that engage in alleged constitutional deprivations while acting under color of federal law
B. holding that the Supreme Court’s implication of a private right of action under § 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 was simply acquiescence in ""the 25-year-old acceptance by the lower federal courts of an implied action""

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), on the ground that the claim had already been “previously determined” in the state system. On federal habeas, a divided panel of the Sixth Circuit held that the state courts’ ruling precluded consideration of the Brady claim. The court of appeals reasoned (in conflict with decisions of five other circuits) that the claim had been “procedurally defaulted.” The court of appeals further reasoned (widening an existing four-to-two circuit split) that the state courts’ ruling was unreviewable.

Here is question: Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits an appellate court to correct a trial court's 'plain error' despite the lack of an objection in the trial court. In Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461 (1997), this Court held that, when the governing law on an issue is settled against the defendant at the time of trial but then changes in the defendant's favor by the time of appeal, 'it is enough that an error be 'plain' at the time of appellate consideration.' Id. at 468. Johnson did not address the timing of plain-error review when the governing law on an issue is unsettled at trial but clarified in the defendant's favor while his appeal is pending. The courts of appeals have split 5 to 3 on the question that Johnson left open. That question, which this case squarely presents, is:
When the governing law is unsettled at the time of trial but settled in the defendant's favor by the time of appeal, should an appellate court reviewing for 'plain error' apply Johnson's time-of-appeal standard, as the First, Second, Sixth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits do, or should the appellate court apply the Ninth Circuit’s time-of-trial standard, which the D.C. Circuit and the panel below have adopted?
Options:
A. holding that a forfeited claim may be considered on appeal where the trial court addressed the merits of a belated objection, and the appellate court does not disagree with the substance of the trial court ruling
B. holding that a trial court must conduct, sua sponte, a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant’s competence
C. holding that a defendant who does not object to a Rule 11 error in the district court is subject to the Rule 52(b) plain-error standard on appeal, even though Rule 11 does not have a provision stating that plain error review applies to claims not brought to the district court's attention
D. holding that a determination about an unsettled question of State law is not a factual issue to be reviewed by an appellate court for clear error, but rather is reviewed de novo
E. holding that even when an appellate court reviews for plain error because the appellant failed to timely assert his claim at trial, whether the law was settled or unsettled at the time of trial, the error is plain as long as it was plain at the time of appellate review

Here is question: In 1937, this Court described as “inveterate and certain,” the principle that an appellee “may not, in the absence of a cross-appeal ... ‘attack the decree with a view either to enlarging his own rights thereunder or lessening the rights of his adversary.” Morely Constr. Co. v. Maryland Cas. Co., 300 U.S. 185, 191 (1937) (citation omitted). In light of this principle, numerous courts have held that a court of appeals may not order an increase in a criminal defendant’s sentence in the absence of an appeal or cross-appeal by the Government. The Eighth and Tenth Circuits, however, have held that courts of appeals may sua sponte order increases in a defendant’s sentence when the district court has failed to impose a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, even if the Government has not appealed or cross-appealed the sentence. The question presented is:
Whether a federal court of appeals may increase a criminal defendant’s sentence sua sponte and in the absence of a cross-appeal by the Government.
Options:
A. holding that, in determining a sentence, the district court may consider a defendant’s failure to cooperate with an ongoing investigation of the criminal scheme of which the defendant was a part

The questions presented are as follows:
Whether the Eleventh Circuit properly held - in conflict with the decisions of this Court and other courts - that there was no ""cause"" to excuse any procedural default where petitioner was blameless for the default, the State's own conduct contributed to the default, and petitioner's attorneys of record were no longer functioning as his agents at the time of any default.

Options:
A. holding that where district court granted summary judgment and appellate court affirmed, the appellate court abused its discretion in declining to decide the pendent state law claim because if the affirmative action plan challenged in the case was invalid under state law, there would have been no need to reach the federal constitutional issue

Here is question: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") expressly grants sole shareholder corporations, partners and sole proprietors the right to be ""participants"" in an ""employee benefit plan"", as those terms are defined in ERISA, if other non-spouse employees participate in the employee benefit plan. Nine circuit courts of appeals and the Department of Labor (""DOL"") have reviewed ERISA, and its regulations, and reached the same conclusion. This Court's holding in Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 112 S.Ct. 1344, 117 L.Ed.2d 581 (1992), provides that the common-law definition of employee should be used to determine who may be a ""participant"" in an employee benefit plan. Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held in Hendon v. Yates (In re Yates), 287 F.3d 521 (6th Cir. 2002), reh'g denied, 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 12550 (6th Cir. June 20, 2002) (Appendix, pp. 1a- 8a, 51a-52a), that a different definition of ""employee"" should be used to determine whether such persons can participate in an employee benefit plan.
The question presented is whether a one hundred percent (100%) shareholder of a corporate employer, partner or a sole proprietor can qualify as a participant in an employee benefit plan sponsored by the employer in which other non-spouse employees, as defined in 29 C.F.R. § 2510.3-3(c), participate, and thus, be entitled to enforce the restrictions against alienation contained in § 206(d) of ERISA and §401(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code (""Code"").
Options:
A. holding that a plan administrator's denial of ERISA benefits is reviewed under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard only if the benefit plan gives the plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan
B. holding that when a federal statute does not provide a definition for ""employee,"" does not give specific guidance on the meaning of the term ""employee,"" and does not otherwise suggest the common-law definition is inappropriate, then the court will presume Congress intended to incorporate the common-law agency definition of ""employee"" into the statute
C. holding that a working shareholder and president of a professional corporation can qualify as a ""participant"" in an ERISA employee benefits plan as long as the plan covers employees other than the shareholder
D. holding that an action for reimbursement under an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (""ERISA"") plan involved a legal determination, and therefore was not authorized as an equitable remedy under § 502 of ERISA, because the petitioners were seeking to impose personal liability on the respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money damages
E. holding that ERISA preempted a state anti-subrogation law, the latter of which prohibited an employee welfare benefit plan from requiring reimbursement from a participant that already had recovered from a third party, and noting that preemption served “to ensure that benefit plans will be governed by only a single set of regulations”

On appeal, Mr. Trevino argued that the Court of Appeals should stay further proceedings until this Court resolved the question then-pending in several cases whether ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in failing to raise a meritorious claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel established cause for the default in state habeas proceedings. The Court of Appeals refused to stay Mr. Trevino's appeal for this purpose. Four months later, this Court decided in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S.Ct. 1309 (March 20, 2012), that ineffective assistance of state habeas counsel in the very circumstance presented by Mr. Trevino's case could establish cause for the default of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. These circumstances present the following question:
Whether the Court should grant certiorari, vacate the Court of Appeals opinion, and remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration of Mr. Trevino's argument under Martinez v. Ryan?
Options:
A. holding that this doctrine applies when a petitioner fails to raise an IAC claim in an initial Texas state habeas proceeding
B. holding that, where the state court's decision was ""contrary to"" clearly established federal law, because it failed to apply the Strickland standards to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the federal court ""can determine the principles necessary to grant relief"" and apply them to the facts of the case
C. holding that petitioner did not have a ""constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment"" and that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during state habeas appellate proceedings does not constitute cause to excuse the procedural defects
D. holding that, in limited circumstances, cause to excuse procedural default might be established by ineffective counsel in state collateral proceedings
E. holding that a defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as cause for procedural default in a § 2254 petition is a constitutional claim that is also sub- ject to being procedurally defaulted if it was not timely raised before the state court

Here is question: May a party appeal an order denying summary judgment after a full trial on the merits if the party chose not to appeal the order before trial?
Options:
A. holding a defendant, before trial, may not appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291 a federal district court's order denying his motion to dismiss an indictment due to an alleged Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation.
B. holding that the defendants did not raise a purely legal issue where the pre-existing law regarding deliberate indifference in a failure to protect context was “not in controversy” and defendants' arguments instead addressed factual questions concerning what the officers knew and what they could have done to protect the plaintiff
C. holding that an ""order denying intervention was not a final, appealable order because it did not dispose of the whole subject matter of the case,"" and thus, the denial order motion can be challenged in an appeal of the final order
D. holding that a grant of summary judgment is mandated ""after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish . . . an element essential to that party's case, . . . on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial""
E. holding that a party may only be held in contempt of a court order if (1) the order clearly and unambiguously imposed an obligation on the party; (2) proof of the party's noncompliance with the order was clear and convincing; and (3

Here is question: Whether the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 42 U .S.C. 2000bb et seq., requires the government to permit the importation, distribution, possession, and use of a Schedule I hallucinogenic controlled substance, where Congress has found that the substance has a high potential for abuse, it is unsafe for use even under medical supervision, and its importation and distribution would violate an international treaty.
Options:
A. holding that the defendant's prosecution for a continuing criminal enterprise under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 following his earlier prosecution for marijuana importation did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause
B. holding that the defendant's prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a ""controlled substance offense"" because the plain language of § 4B1.2(b) requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distribute
C. holding that Congress can constitutionally prohibit the importation of obscene material from abroad, even if it is imported for personal use rather than for commercial distribution
D. holding that, in the analogous context of a preliminary injunction under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, ""the burdens at the preliminary injunction stage track the burdens at trial"" such that it was the government's burden to satisfy RFRA's strict scrutiny standard and not the plaintiff's burden to disprove it
E. holding that defendant who distributed drugs used by victim who died of a drug overdose after also using other drugs could not be convicted under penalty enhancement provision of Controlled Substance Act applicable when death results from use of the distributed substance unless such use is a ""but-for"" cause of the death

Here is question: To ensure that interstate commerce is ""not impeded by diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations,"" Congress has precluded the States from imposing any ""requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes,"" and has authorized the Federal Trade Commission to regulate ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the advertising of cigarettes."" 15 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1334, 1336. Based on studies suggesting that cigarettes with comparatively lower tar and nicotine yields may present fewer health risks, the FTC requires tobacco companies to disclose those yields as measured using an FTC-mandated test, and has authorized tobacco companies to advertise cigarettes using ""descriptors,"" such as ""light,"" as shorthand references to the numerical test results. Respondents in this case contend that such descriptors are misleading, in violation of a state deceptive trade practices statute.
Whether state-law challenges to FTC-authorized statements regarding tar and nicotine yields in cigarette advertising are expressly or impliedly preempted by federal law.
Options:
A. holding that misleading advertising may be prohibited entirely, but the state may not place an absolute prohibition on certain types of potentially misleading information, e.g., a listing of areas of law practice, if the information may be presented in a way that is not deceptive
B. holding that federal law authorized states to decide whether to allow in-state banks to be purchased by out-of-state holding companies
C. holding that where ""the legal incidence of California's cigarette tax falls on the non-Indian consumers of cigarettes purchased from respondent's smoke shop, [the State has the right to] require [the smokeshop] to collect the tax on [the State's] behalf.""
D. holding that the Labeling Act preempts state regulations specifically targeting cigarette advertising, but does not preempt state regulation of cigarette use or sales, or imposition of regulations of general applicability, such as zoning, which may have an effect on cigarette advertising
E. holding that plaintiffs' claims under the MUTPA were not preempted by the FCLAA because ""[t]he duty [not to deceive] codified in that state statute, like the duty imposed by the state common-law rule at issue in Cipollone, has nothing to do with smoking and health""

Here is question: Whether law enforcement agents may be liable under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), for retaliatory prosecution in violation of the First Amendment when the prosecution was supported by probable cause.
Options:
A. holding that where law enforcement agents provided the defendant with ingredients for illegal manufacture of drugs, the agents' participation was not unfair or shocking to any sense of justice because it related to criminal activity already in progress
B. holding that IRS agents violated the Fourth Amendment when they seized taxpayer property during a warrantless search and remanding for a determination of whether the plaintiff's Bivens action should be dismissed because the IRS agents acted in good faith
C. holding that ""[t]o prevail on a first amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must establish a ‘causal connection’ between the defendant's retaliatory animus and the plaintiff's ‘subsequent injury’ .... [A]n official's ‘action colored by some degree of bad motive does not amount to a constitutional tort if that action would have been taken anyway’ ""

E. holding that an action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.

Options:
A. holding that probable cause to search that existed at roadside still existed when car was transported to station house, where car was searched, despite dissenting Justice's contention that nothing showed that it would have been impractical or unsafe to search car at roadside
B. holding that a warrantless search of the arrestee's jacket which was within the arrestee's immediate control inside the passenger compartment of the car just prior to his arrest was a valid search incident to a lawful custodial arrest
C. holding that it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to stop a vehicle near the international border and question the occupants about their immigration status and citizenship where the only ground for suspicion that the occupants of the vehicle are aliens is the occupants' apparent Mexican ancestry
